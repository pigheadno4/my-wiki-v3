## Definition

Metronome presents invoicing as a set of distribution-channel options rather than one mandatory delivery path. Its overview identifies native Stripe invoicing, marketplace invoicing for AWS, Azure, and GCP, and ERP-oriented invoicing and revenue workflows.

## Invoicing options

| Option | Documented scope |
| --- | --- |
| Stripe Invoicing | Native Stripe integration that can use Stripe Tax, dunning, and other Stripe product-suite capabilities. |
| Marketplace Invoicing | Out-of-the-box metering and invoice creation for AWS, Azure, and GCP marketplaces, covering all Metronome charge types without a third-party integrator. |
| ERP Invoicing | Out-of-the-box and custom ERP integrations for collection, book-closing, and revenue workflows; the overview highlights NetSuite as a native option. |

## Selection model

The overview emphasizes optionality: organizations can use simpler integrated invoicing, marketplace distribution, or ERP systems according to their contracting and revenue-process needs. It does not define invoice objects, lifecycle states, synchronization details, or integration setup; those require the linked dedicated guides.
