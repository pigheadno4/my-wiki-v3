## Definition

Metronome presents invoicing as a set of distribution-channel options rather than one mandatory delivery path. Its overview identifies native Stripe invoicing, marketplace invoicing for AWS, Azure, and GCP, and ERP-oriented invoicing and revenue workflows.

## Invoicing options

| Option | Documented scope |
| --- | --- |
| Stripe Invoicing | Native Stripe integration that can use Stripe Tax, dunning, and other Stripe product-suite capabilities. |
| Marketplace Invoicing | Out-of-the-box metering and invoice creation for AWS, Azure, and GCP marketplaces, covering all Metronome charge types without a third-party integrator. |
| ERP Invoicing | Out-of-the-box and custom ERP integrations for collection, book-closing, and revenue workflows; the overview highlights NetSuite as a native option. |

## Selection model

The overview emphasizes optionality: organizations can use simpler integrated invoicing, marketplace distribution, or ERP systems according to their contracting and revenue-process needs. It does not define invoice objects, lifecycle states, synchronization details, or integration setup; those require the linked dedicated guides.

## Event-based invoice preview

Metronome exposes `POST /v1/customers/{customer_id}/previewEvents` to calculate draft invoices from supplied usage events and the customer's current contract configuration before those events are processed. The request can replace historical usage or merge with it, and the response returns draft invoice records with totals and line items. Contracts using SQL billable metrics are excluded from this preview capability.

## Native Stripe invoice delivery

- Stripe connections are scoped to a Metronome environment; sandbox connects to Stripe test mode.
- Customer billing configuration selects the Stripe customer and collection method. Multi-account setups require `delivery_method_id`; contract-level configuration can route contracts independently.
- Adding Stripe to an existing contract does not send earlier finalized invoices retroactively.
- `charge_automatically` requires a Stripe default payment method. Stripe can wait up to one hour after `invoice.created` before attempting payment, or 72 hours when that webhook delivery fails.
- Account-level settings can leave invoices as drafts, skip invoices below the currency minimum, adjust presentation, or align `effective_at` to the service period. The guide says that alignment is incompatible with Stripe Tax.

Metronome receives Stripe invoice-status changes through webhooks and exposes mapped external status through its invoice API and data export. No external status appears in Metronome when the integration deliberately leaves the Stripe invoice as a draft.

## Stripe representation limits

Decimal quantities are moved into descriptions while Stripe line-item quantities become `1`; invoices over 250 line items collapse into one Stripe item. The guide also documents a maximum-charge error and no native Stripe credit-memo support. These transformations mean the Metronome invoice remains the detailed billing record when Stripe representation is compressed.
