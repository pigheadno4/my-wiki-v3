## Overview

Adyen Online Payments is Adyen's documentation area for accepting card, wallet, and local payment methods on websites and mobile apps.

## Integration architecture

At overview level, the integration is divided among a payments server that calls Checkout API endpoints, a client website or app that collects shopper payment details and passes payment information to the server, and a webhook server that receives payment-status and other payments-related activity. The overview recommends API Libraries and Drop-in/Components; it does not state that those choices are mandatory. Library/API updates and the product lifecycle remain qualifications when applying the overview to a specific implementation.
