# UPI payments

Use the Payment Intents and Payment Methods APIs to accept UPI payments, a common payment method in India.

# Checkout

> This is a Checkout for when payment-ui is checkout. View the full page at https://docs.stripe.com/payments/upi/accept-a-payment?payment-ui=checkout.

> Stripe can automatically present the relevant payment methods to your customers by evaluating currency, payment method restrictions, and other parameters.
>
> - Follow the [Accept a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md?payment-ui=checkout&ui=stripe-hosted) guide to build a Checkout integration that uses [dynamic payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods.md).

- If you don’t want to use dynamic payment methods, follow the steps below to manually configure the payment methods in your Checkout integration.

Customers pay with UPI by authenticating on their mobile and approving you to accept a payment or future charges.

For one-off payments and those where you save the payment method for future use, you get an [immediate notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#payment-notification) on whether the payment succeeded or failed. For off-session or recurring payments where the customer isn’t present, you get a delayed notification.

## Determine compatibility

**Supported business locations**: US, EU, CA, GB, AU, SG, CH

**Supported currencies**: `inr`

**Presentment currencies**: `inr`

**Payment mode**: Yes

**Setup mode**: Yes

**Subscription mode**: Yes

To support UPI in Checkout, *prices* (Prices define how much and how often to charge for products. This includes how much the product costs, what currency to use, and the interval if the price is for subscriptions) for all line items must be expressed in Indian rupees (currency code `inr`). UPI supports one-time payments and recurring *subscriptions* (A Subscription represents the product details associated with the plan that your customer subscribes to. Allows you to charge the customer on a recurring basis) through e-mandates (UPI AutoPay).

## Accept a payment

> This guide builds on the foundational [accept a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md?ui=stripe-hosted) Checkout integration.

This guides you through enabling UPI and shows the differences between accepting payments using dynamic payment methods and manually configuring payment methods.

### Enable UPI as a payment method

When creating a new [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions.md), you need to:

1. Add `upi` to the list of `payment_method_types`.
1. Make sure all your `line_items` use the `inr` currency.

#### Stripe-hosted page

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  line_items: [
    {
      price_data: {
        currency: "inr",
        product_data: {
          name: "T-shirt",
        },
        unit_amount: 20000,
      },
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ],
  mode: "payment",
  payment_method_types: ["card", "upi"],
  success_url: "https://example.com/success",
});
```

#### Full embedded page

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  line_items: [
    {
      price_data: {
        currency: "inr",
        product_data: {
          name: "T-shirt",
        },
        unit_amount: 20000,
      },
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ],
  mode: "payment",
  payment_method_types: ["card", "upi"],
  return_url: "https://example.com/return",
  ui_mode: "embedded_page",
});
```

### UPI-specific considerations

UPI QR codes expire 5 minutes after creation. Customers can’t use an expired UPI QR code to complete a payment. As soon as a UPI QR code expires, Stripe sends a [payment_intent.payment_failed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-payment_intent.payment_failed) event.

### Fulfill your orders

After accepting a payment, learn how to [fulfill orders](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment.md).

## Test your integration

When testing your Checkout integration, select UPI as the payment method and click **Pay**. A QR code opens, which you can scan to open a Stripe-hosted UPI test payment page. From this page, you can either authorize or expire the test payment.

# Checkout Sessions API

> This is a Checkout Sessions API for when payment-ui is elements and api-integration is checkout. View the full page at https://docs.stripe.com/payments/upi/accept-a-payment?payment-ui=elements&api-integration=checkout.

To determine which API meets your business needs, see the [comparison guide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout-sessions-and-payment-intents-comparison.md).

Use the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md) to embed a custom Stripe payment form in your website or application and offer payment methods to customers. For advanced configurations and customizations, refer to the [Accept a Payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md) integration guide.

## Determine compatibility

UPI is only available for payments in Indian rupees (INR). Prices for all line items must be expressed in Indian rupees (currency code `inr`).

## Set up the server [Server-side]

Use the official Stripe libraries to access the API from your application.

#### Node.js

```bash
# Install with npm
npm install stripe --save
```

## Create a Checkout Session [Server-side]

Add an endpoint on your server that creates a [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md) and returns its [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/object.md#checkout_session_object-client_secret) to your front end. A Checkout Session represents your customer’s session as they pay for one-time purchases or subscriptions. Checkout Sessions expire 24 hours after creation.

We recommend using [dynamic payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods.md) to dynamically display the most relevant eligible payment methods to each customer to maximize conversion. You can also [manually list payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/integration-options.md#listing-payment-methods-manually), which disables dynamic payment methods.

#### Manage payment methods from the Dashboard

#### TypeScript

```javascript
import express, {Express} from 'express';

const app: Express = express();

app.post('/create-checkout-session', async (req: Express.Request, res: Express.Response) => {
  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    line_items: [
      {
        price_data: {
          currency: 'inr',
          product_data: {
            name: 'T-shirt',
          },
          unit_amount: 12300,
        },
        quantity: 1,
      },
    ],
    mode: 'payment',
    ui_mode: 'elements',
    return_url: 'https://example.com/return?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}'
  });

  res.json({checkoutSessionClientSecret: session.client_secret});
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Running on port 3000');
});
```

#### Manually list payment methods

#### TypeScript

```javascript
import express, {Express} from 'express';

const app: Express = express();

app.post('/create-checkout-session', async (req: Express.Request, res: Express.Response) => {
  const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
    line_items: [
      {
        price_data: {
          currency: 'inr',
          product_data: {
            name: 'T-shirt',
          },
          unit_amount: 12300,
        },
        quantity: 1,
      },
    ],
    mode: 'payment',
    ui_mode: 'elements',
    payment_method_types: ['upi'],
    return_url: 'https://example.com/return?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}'
  });

  res.json({checkoutSessionClientSecret: session.client_secret});
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Running on port 3000');
});
```

## Set up the front end [Client-side]

#### HTML + JS

Include the Stripe.js script on your checkout page by adding it to the `head` of your HTML file. Always load Stripe.js directly from js.stripe.com to remain PCI compliant. Don’t include the script in a bundle or host a copy of it yourself.

Make sure you’re on the latest Stripe.js version by including the following script tag `<script src=“https://js.stripe.com/dahlia/stripe.js”></script>`. Learn more about [Stripe.js versioning](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/stripejs-versioning.md).

```html
<head>
  <title>Checkout</title>
  <script src="https://js.stripe.com/dahlia/stripe.js"></script>
</head>
```

> Stripe provides an npm package that you can use to load Stripe.js as a module. See the [project on GitHub](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-js). Version [7.0.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/%40stripe/stripe-js/v/7.0.0) or later is required.

Initialize stripe.js.

```js
// Set your publishable key: remember to change this to your live publishable key in production
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
const stripe = Stripe("<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>");
```

#### React

Install [React Stripe.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stripe/react-stripe-js) and the [Stripe.js loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stripe/stripe-js) from the npm public registry. You need at least version 5.0.0 for React Stripe.js and version 8.0.0 for the Stripe.js loader.

```bash
npm install --save @stripe/react-stripe-js@^5.0.0 @stripe/stripe-js@^8.0.0
```

Initialize a `stripe` instance on your front end with your publishable key.

```javascript
import { loadStripe } from "@stripe/stripe-js";
const stripe = loadStripe("<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>");
```

## Initialize Checkout [Client-side]

#### HTML + JS

Create either a `clientSecret` promise that resolves with the client secret or set it as the secret directly. Call [initCheckoutElementsSdk](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/init), passing in `clientSecret`. `initCheckoutElementsSdk` returns a [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout) instance.

The [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout) object acts as the foundation of your checkout page, and contains data from the Checkout Session and methods to update the Session.

The object returned by [actions.getSession()](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/session) contains your pricing information. We recommend reading and displaying the `total`, and `lineItems` from the session in your UI.

This lets you turn on new features with minimal code changes. For example, adding [manual currency prices](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/custom/localize-prices/manual-currency-prices.md) requires no UI changes if you display the `total`.

```javascript
const clientSecret = fetch("/create-checkout-session", { method: "POST" })
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((json) => json.checkoutSessionClientSecret);
const checkout = stripe.initCheckoutElementsSdk({ clientSecret });
const loadActionsResult = await checkout.loadActions();
if (loadActionsResult.type === "success") {
  const session = loadActionsResult.actions.getSession();
  const checkoutContainer = document.getElementById("checkout-container");
  checkoutContainer.append(JSON.stringify(session.lineItems, null, 2));
  checkoutContainer.append(document.createElement("br"));
  checkoutContainer.append(`Total: ${session.total.total.amount}`);
}
```

```html
<div id="checkout-container"></div>
```

#### React

Create `clientSecret` as a `Promise<string> | string` containing the client secret returned by your server.

Wrap your application with the [CheckoutElementsProvider](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/checkout_provider) component, passing in `clientSecret` and the `stripe` instance.

Use the [useCheckoutElements](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/use_checkout_elements) hook in your components to get the [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout) object, which contains data from the Checkout Session and methods to update the Session.

Use the `Checkout` object as the container for your prices. We recommend reading and displaying the `total` and `lineItems` from the `Checkout` object in your UI.

This lets you enable features with minimal code changes. For example, adding [manual currency prices](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/custom/localize-prices/manual-currency-prices.md) requires no UI changes if you display the `total`.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { CheckoutElementsProvider } from "@stripe/react-stripe-js/checkout";
import CheckoutForm from "./CheckoutForm";

const clientSecret = fetch("/create-checkout-session", { method: "POST" })
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((json) => json.checkoutSessionClientSecret);

const App = () => {
  return (
    <CheckoutElementsProvider stripe={stripe} options={{ clientSecret }}>
      <CheckoutForm />
    </CheckoutElementsProvider>
  );
};

export default App;
```

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useCheckoutElements } from "@stripe/react-stripe-js/checkout";

const CheckoutForm = () => {
  const checkoutState = useCheckoutElements();
  switch (checkoutState.type) {
    case "loading":
      return <div>Loading ...</div>;
    case "error":
      return <div>Error: {checkoutState.error.message}</div>;
    case "success":
      return (
        <pre>
          {JSON.stringify(checkoutState.checkout.lineItems, null, 2)}
          // A formatted total amount Total:{" "}
          {checkoutState.checkout.total.total.amount}
        </pre>
      );
  }
};
```

## Collect customer email [Client-side]

#### HTML + JS

> You can skip this step if you set the customer’s email in one of the following ways:
>
> - Set it directly in [customer_email](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-customer_email) when creating the Checkout Session.

- Provide a [customer_account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-customer_account) or [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-customer) that has an email when creating the Checkout Session.
- Implement your own email validation and provide the validated email in [email](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/confirm) when confirming the Checkout Session.

Create an email input to collect your customer’s email address. Call [updateEmail](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/update_email) when your customer finishes the input to validate and save the email address.

Depending on the design of your checkout form, you can call `updateEmail` in the following ways:

- Directly before [submitting the payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/upi/accept-a-payment.md#submit-payment). You can also call `updateEmail` to validate earlier, such as on input blur.
- Before transitioning to the next step, such as clicking a **Save** button, if your form includes multiple steps.

```html
<input type="text" id="email" />
<div id="email-errors"></div>
```

```javascript
const checkout = stripe.initCheckoutElementsSdk({ clientSecret });
const loadActionsResult = await checkout.loadActions();

if (loadActionsResult.type === "success") {
  const { actions } = loadActionsResult;
  const emailInput = document.getElementById("email");
  const emailErrors = document.getElementById("email-errors");

  emailInput.addEventListener("input", () => {
    // Clear any validation errors
    emailErrors.textContent = "";
  });

  emailInput.addEventListener("blur", () => {
    const newEmail = emailInput.value;
    actions.updateEmail(newEmail).then((result) => {
      if (result.error) {
        emailErrors.textContent = result.error.message;
      }
    });
  });
}
```

- Implement your own email validation and pass in the validated email on [confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/confirm) for the Checkout Session.

Create a component to collect your customer’s email address. Call [updateEmail](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/update_email) when your customer finishes the input to validate and save the email address.

Depending on the design of your checkout form, you can call `updateEmail` in the following ways:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useCheckoutElements } from "@stripe/react-stripe-js/checkout";

const EmailInput = () => {
  const checkoutState = useCheckoutElements();
  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState("");
  const [error, setError] = React.useState(null);

  if (checkoutState.type === "loading") {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  } else if (checkoutState.type === "error") {
    return <div>Error: {checkoutState.error.message}</div>;
  }

  const handleBlur = () => {
    checkoutState.checkout.updateEmail(email).then((result) => {
      if (result.type === "error") {
        setError(result.error);
      }
    });
  };

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    setError(null);
    setEmail(e.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <label htmlFor="checkout-form-email">Email</label>
      <input
        id="checkout-form-email"
        type="email"
        value={email}
        onChange={handleChange}
        onBlur={handleBlur}
      />
      {error && <div>{error.message}</div>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default EmailInput;
```

## Collect payment details [Client-side]

Collect payment details on the client with the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md). The Payment Element is a prebuilt UI component that simplifies collecting payment details for a variety of payment methods.

#### HTML + JS

First, create a container DOM element to mount the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md). Then create an instance of the `Payment Element` using [checkout.createPaymentElement](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/create_payment_element) and mount it by calling [element.mount](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/mount), providing either a CSS selector or the container DOM element.

```html
<div id="payment-element"></div>
```

```javascript
const paymentElement = checkout.createPaymentElement();
paymentElement.mount("#payment-element");
```

See the [Stripe.js docs](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/create_payment_element#custom_checkout_create_payment_element-options) to view the supported options.

You can [customize the appearance](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization/appearance.md) of all Elements by passing [elementsOptions.appearance](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/init#custom_checkout_init-options-elementsOptions-appearance) when initializing Checkout on the front end.

#### React

Mount the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md) component within the [CheckoutElementsProvider](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/checkout_provider).

```jsx
import React from "react";
import {
  PaymentElement,
  useCheckoutElements,
} from "@stripe/react-stripe-js/checkout";

const CheckoutForm = () => {
  const checkoutState = useCheckoutElements();
  return (
    <form>
      <PaymentElement options={{ layout: "accordion" }} />
    </form>
  );
};

export default CheckoutForm;
```

See the [Stripe.js docs](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/create_payment_element#custom_checkout_create_payment_element-options) to view the supported options.

You can [customize the appearance](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/customization/appearance.md) of all Elements by passing [elementsOptions.appearance](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/checkout_provider#react_checkout_provider-options-elementsOptions-appearance) to the [CheckoutElementsProvider](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/checkout_provider).

## Submit the payment [Client-side]

#### HTML + JS

Render a **Pay** button that calls [confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/confirm) from the `Checkout` instance to submit the payment.

```html
<button id="pay-button">Pay</button>
<div id="confirm-errors"></div>
```

```js
const checkout = stripe.initCheckoutElementsSdk({ clientSecret });

checkout.on("change", (session) => {
  document.getElementById("pay-button").disabled = !session.canConfirm;
});

const loadActionsResult = await checkout.loadActions();

if (loadActionsResult.type === "success") {
  const { actions } = loadActionsResult;
  const button = document.getElementById("pay-button");
  const errors = document.getElementById("confirm-errors");
  button.addEventListener("click", () => {
    // Clear any validation errors
    errors.textContent = "";

    actions.confirm().then((result) => {
      if (result.type === "error") {
        errors.textContent = result.error.message;
      }
    });
  });
}
```

#### React

Render a **Pay** button that calls [confirm](https://docs.stripe.com/js/custom_checkout/confirm) from [useCheckoutElements](https://docs.stripe.com/js/react_stripe_js/checkout/use_checkout_elements) to submit the payment.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useCheckoutElements } from "@stripe/react-stripe-js/checkout";

const PayButton = () => {
  const checkoutState = useCheckoutElements();
  const [loading, setLoading] = React.useState(false);
  const [error, setError] = React.useState(null);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setLoading(true);
    checkoutState.checkout.confirm().then((result) => {
      if (result.type === "error") {
        setError(result.error);
      }
      setLoading(false);
    });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button
        disabled={!checkoutState.checkout.canConfirm || loading}
        onClick={handleClick}
      >
        Pay
      </button>
      {error && <div>{error.message}</div>}
    </div>
  );
};

export default PayButton;
```

## Test your integration

When testing your integration, select UPI as the payment method and click **Pay**. A QR code opens, which you can scan to open a Stripe-hosted UPI test payment page. From this page, you can either authorize or expire the test payment.

# Payment Intents API

> This is a Payment Intents API for when payment-ui is elements and api-integration is paymentintents. View the full page at https://docs.stripe.com/payments/upi/accept-a-payment?payment-ui=elements&api-integration=paymentintents.

Customers pay with UPI by authenticating on their mobile and approving you to accept a payment or future charges.

For one-off payments and those where you save the payment method for future use, you get an [immediate notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#payment-notification) on whether the payment succeeded or failed. For off-session or recurring payments where the customer isn’t present, you get a delayed notification.

## Set up Stripe [Server-side]

To get started, [create a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).

Use our official libraries for access to the Stripe API from your application:

#### Node.js

```bash
# Install with npm
npm install stripe --save
```

## Create a PaymentIntent [Server-side]

Stripe uses a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md) object to represent your intent to collect payment from a customer, tracking charge attempts, and payment state changes throughout the process.

#### Manage payment methods from the Dashboard

Create a PaymentIntent on your server with an amount and currency. In the latest version of the API, specifying the `automatic_payment_methods` parameter is optional because Stripe enables its functionality by default. You can manage payment methods from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Stripe determines eligible payment methods based on factors such as the transaction’s amount, currency, and payment flow. Make sure **UPI** is turned on in the [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) page.

Always decide how much to charge on the server side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents malicious customers from being able to choose their own prices.

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 12300,
  currency: "inr",
  automatic_payment_methods: {
    enabled: true,
  },
});
```

#### List payment methods manually

If you don’t want to use the Dashboard or want to manually specify payment methods, you can list them using the `payment_method_types` attribute.

Create a PaymentIntent on your server with an amount, currency, and a list of payment methods. Always decide how much to charge on the server side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents malicious customers from being able to choose their own prices.

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 12300,
  currency: "inr",
  payment_method_types: ["upi"],
});
```

### Retrieve the client secret

The PaymentIntent includes a *client secret* (The client secret is a unique key returned from Stripe as part of a PaymentIntent. This key lets the client access important fields from the PaymentIntent (status, amount, currency) while hiding sensitive ones (metadata, customer)) that the client side uses to securely complete the payment process. You can use different approaches to pass the client secret to the client side.

#### Single-page application

Retrieve the client secret from an endpoint on your server, using the browser’s `fetch` function. This approach is best if your client side is a single-page application, particularly one built with a modern frontend framework like React. Create the server endpoint that serves the client secret:

#### Node.js

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/secret", async (req, res) => {
  const intent = // ... Fetch or create the PaymentIntent
    res.json({ client_secret: intent.client_secret });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Running on port 3000");
});
```

And then fetch the client secret with JavaScript on the client side:

```javascript
(async () => {
  const response = await fetch("/secret");
  const { client_secret: clientSecret } = await response.json();
  // Render the form using the clientSecret
})();
```

#### Server-side rendering

Pass the client secret to the client from your server. This approach works best if your application generates static content on the server before sending it to the browser.

Add the [client_secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret) in your checkout form. In your server-side code, retrieve the client secret from the PaymentIntent:

#### Node.js

```html
<form id="payment-form" data-secret="{{ client_secret }}">
  <div id="payment-element">
    <!-- Elements will create form elements here -->
  </div>

  <button id="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const expressHandlebars = require("express-handlebars");
const app = express();

app.engine(".hbs", expressHandlebars({ extname: ".hbs" }));
app.set("view engine", ".hbs");
app.set("views", "./views");

app.get("/checkout", async (req, res) => {
  const intent = // ... Fetch or create the PaymentIntent
    res.render("checkout", { client_secret: intent.client_secret });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Running on port 3000");
});
```

## Collect payment details [Client-side]

Collect payment details on the client with the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md). The Payment Element is a prebuilt UI component that simplifies collecting payment details for a variety of payment methods.

The Payment Element contains an iframe that securely sends payment information to Stripe over an HTTPS connection. Avoid placing the Payment Element within another iframe because some payment methods require redirecting to another page for payment confirmation.

If you choose to use an iframe and want to accept Apple Pay or Google Pay, the iframe must have the [allow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attr-allowpaymentrequest) attribute set to equal `"payment *"`.

The checkout page address must start with `https://` rather than `http://` for your integration to work. You can test your integration without using HTTPS, but remember to [enable it](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide.md#tls) when you’re ready to accept live payments.

#### HTML + JS

### Set up Stripe.js

The Payment Element is automatically available as a feature of Stripe.js. Include the Stripe.js script on your checkout page by adding it to the `head` of your HTML file. Always load Stripe.js directly from js.stripe.com to remain PCI compliant. Don’t include the script in a bundle or host a copy of it yourself.

```html
<head>
  <title>Checkout</title>
  <script src="https://js.stripe.com/dahlia/stripe.js"></script>
</head>
```

Create an instance of Stripe with the following JavaScript on your checkout page:

```javascript
// Set your publishable key: remember to change this to your live publishable key in production
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
const stripe = Stripe("<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>");
```

### Add the Payment Element to your payment page

The Payment Element needs a place to live on your payment page. Create an empty DOM node (container) with a unique ID in your payment form:

```html
<form id="payment-form">
  <div id="payment-element">
    <!-- Elements will create form elements here -->
  </div>
  <button id="submit">Submit</button>
  <div id="error-message">
    <!-- Display error message to your customers here -->
  </div>
</form>
```

When the previous form loads, create an instance of the Payment Element and mount it to the container DOM node. Pass the [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret) from the previous step into `options` when you create the [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create) instance:

Handle the client secret carefully because it can complete the charge. Don’t log it, embed it in URLs, or expose it to anyone but the customer.

```javascript
const options = {
  clientSecret: "{{CLIENT_SECRET}}",
  // Fully customizable with appearance API.
  appearance: {
    /*...*/
  },
};

// Set up Stripe.js and Elements to use in checkout form, passing the client secret obtained in a previous stepconst elements = stripe.elements(options);
// Optional: Autofill user's saved payment methods. If the customer's
// email is known when the page is loaded, you can pass the email
// to the linkAuthenticationElement on mount:
//
//   linkAuthenticationElement.mount("#link-authentication-element",  {
//     defaultValues: {
//       email: 'jenny.rosen@example.com',
//     }
//   })

// Create and mount the Payment Element
const paymentElementOptions = { layout: "accordion" };
const paymentElement = elements.create("payment", paymentElementOptions);
paymentElement.mount("#payment-element");
```

#### React

### Set up Stripe.js

Install [React Stripe.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stripe/react-stripe-js) and the [Stripe.js loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stripe/stripe-js) from the npm public registry:

```bash
npm install --save @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js
```

### Add and configure the Elements provider to your payment page

To use the Payment Element component, wrap your checkout page component in an [Elements provider](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/stripejs-react.md#elements-provider). Call `loadStripe` with your publishable key, and pass the returned `Promise` to the `Elements` provider. Also pass the [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret) from the previous step as `options` to the `Elements` provider.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { Elements } from "@stripe/react-stripe-js";
import { loadStripe } from "@stripe/stripe-js";

import CheckoutForm from "./CheckoutForm";

// Make sure to call `loadStripe` outside of a component’s render to avoid
// recreating the `Stripe` object on every render.
const stripePromise = loadStripe("<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>");

function App() {
  const options = {
    // passing the client secret obtained in step 3
    clientSecret: "{{CLIENT_SECRET}}",
    // Fully customizable with appearance API.
    appearance: {
      /*...*/
    },
  };

  return (
    <Elements stripe={stripePromise} options={options}>
      <CheckoutForm />
    </Elements>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

### Add the Payment Element component

Use the `PaymentElement` component to build your form:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {PaymentElement} from '@stripe/react-stripe-js';

const CheckoutForm = () => {
  return (
    <form>
      // Optional: Autofill user's saved payment methods. If the customer's
      // email is known when the page is loaded, you can pass the email
      // to the linkAuthenticationElement
      //
      // <LinkAuthenticationElement id="link-authentication-element"
        // Prefill the email field like so:
        // options={{defaultValues: {email: 'foo@bar.com'}}}
      // /><PaymentElement />
      <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default CheckoutForm;
```

## Submit the payment to Stripe [Client-side]

Use [stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment) to complete the payment using details from the Payment Element. Provide a [return_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create.md#create_payment_intent-return_url) to this function to indicate where Stripe should redirect the user after they complete the payment. Your user may be first redirected to an intermediate site, like a bank authorization page, before being redirected to the `return_url`. Card payments immediately redirect to the `return_url` when a payment is successful.

#### HTML + JS

```javascript
const form = document.getElementById("payment-form");

form.addEventListener("submit", async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const { error } = await stripe.confirmPayment({
    //`Elements` instance that was used to create the Payment Element
    elements,
    confirmParams: {
      return_url: "https://example.com/order/123/complete",
    },
  });

  if (error) {
    // This point will only be reached if there is an immediate error when
    // confirming the payment. Show error to your customer (for example, payment
    // details incomplete)
    const messageContainer = document.querySelector("#error-message");
    messageContainer.textContent = error.message;
  } else {
    // Your customer will be redirected to your `return_url`. For some payment
    // methods like iDEAL, your customer will be redirected to an intermediate
    // site first to authorize the payment, then redirected to the `return_url`.
  }
});
```

#### React

To call [stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment) from your payment form component, use the [useStripe](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/stripejs-react.md#usestripe-hook) and [useElements](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/stripejs-react.md#useelements-hook) hooks.

If you prefer traditional class components over hooks, you can instead use an [ElementsConsumer](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/stripejs-react.md#elements-consumer).

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import {
  useStripe,
  useElements,
  PaymentElement,
} from "@stripe/react-stripe-js";

const CheckoutForm = () => {
  const stripe = useStripe();
  const elements = useElements();

  const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState(null);

  const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    // We don't want to let default form submission happen here,
    // which would refresh the page.
    event.preventDefault();

    if (!stripe || !elements) {
      // Stripe.js hasn't yet loaded.
      // Make sure to disable form submission until Stripe.js has loaded.
      return;
    }
    const { error } = await stripe.confirmPayment({
      //`Elements` instance that was used to create the Payment Element
      elements,
      confirmParams: {
        return_url: "https://example.com/order/123/complete",
      },
    });

    if (error) {
      // This point will only be reached if there is an immediate error when
      // confirming the payment. Show error to your customer (for example, payment
      // details incomplete)
      setErrorMessage(error.message);
    } else {
      // Your customer will be redirected to your `return_url`. For some payment
      // methods like iDEAL, your customer will be redirected to an intermediate
      // site first to authorize the payment, then redirected to the `return_url`.
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <PaymentElement />
      <button disabled={!stripe}>Submit</button>
      {/* Show error message to your customers */}
      {errorMessage && <div>{errorMessage}</div>}
    </form>
  );
};

export default CheckoutForm;
```

Make sure the `return_url` corresponds to a page on your website that provides the status of the payment. When Stripe redirects the customer to the `return_url`, we provide the following URL query parameters:

| Parameter                      | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `payment_intent`               | The unique identifier for the `PaymentIntent`.                                                                                                |
| `payment_intent_client_secret` | The [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret) of the `PaymentIntent` object. |

> If you have tooling that tracks the customer’s browser session, you might need to add the `stripe.com` domain to the referrer exclude list. Redirects cause some tools to create new sessions, which prevents you from tracking the complete session.

Use one of the query parameters to retrieve the PaymentIntent. Inspect the [status of the PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paymentintents/lifecycle.md) to decide what to show your customers. You can also append your own query parameters when providing the `return_url`, which persist through the redirect process.

#### HTML + JS

```javascript
// Initialize Stripe.js using your publishable key
const stripe = Stripe("<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>");

// Retrieve the "payment_intent_client_secret" query parameter appended to
// your return_url by Stripe.js
const clientSecret = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get(
  "payment_intent_client_secret",
);

// Retrieve the PaymentIntent
stripe.retrievePaymentIntent(clientSecret).then(({ paymentIntent }) => {
  const message = document.querySelector("#message");

  // Inspect the PaymentIntent `status` to indicate the status of the payment
  // to your customer.
  //
  // Some payment methods will [immediately succeed or fail][0] upon
  // confirmation, while others will first enter a `processing` state.
  //
  // [0]: https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification
  switch (paymentIntent.status) {
    case "succeeded":
      message.innerText = "Success! Payment received.";
      break;

    case "processing":
      message.innerText =
        "Payment processing. We'll update you when payment is received.";
      break;

    case "requires_payment_method":
      message.innerText = "Payment failed. Please try another payment method.";
      // Redirect your user back to your payment page to attempt collecting
      // payment again
      break;

    default:
      message.innerText = "Something went wrong.";
      break;
  }
});
```

#### React

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useStripe } from "@stripe/react-stripe-js";

const PaymentStatus = () => {
  const stripe = useStripe();
  const [message, setMessage] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!stripe) {
      return;
    }

    // Retrieve the "payment_intent_client_secret" query parameter appended to
    // your return_url by Stripe.js
    const clientSecret = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get(
      "payment_intent_client_secret",
    );

    // Retrieve the PaymentIntent
    stripe.retrievePaymentIntent(clientSecret).then(({ paymentIntent }) => {
      // Inspect the PaymentIntent `status` to indicate the status of the payment
      // to your customer.
      //

      switch (paymentIntent.status) {
        case "succeeded":
          setMessage("Success! Payment received.");
          break;

        case "processing":
          setMessage(
            "Payment processing. We'll update you when payment is received.",
          );
          break;

        case "requires_payment_method":
          // Redirect your user back to your payment page to attempt collecting
          // payment again
          setMessage("Payment failed. Please try another payment method.");
