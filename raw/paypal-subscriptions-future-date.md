# Start a subscription for a future date

You can let your customers start their subscriptions on a future date. This is useful when customers want to start a new subscription after a current subscription ends, or when they wish to take advantage of a current promotion but activate their subscription on a later date.

If you start a subscription on a future date, any [setup or one-time fee](/docs/subscriptions/customize/one-time-fee/) associated with the subscription is charged immediately upon sign-up, but regular payments towards the subscription will start on the selected date.

You can update the subscription’s start date as long as it's in the future.
