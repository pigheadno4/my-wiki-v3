# Accept a payment with Amazon Pay

Learn how to set up your integration with Amazon Pay.

# Checkout

> This is a Checkout for when payment-ui is checkout. View the full page at https://docs.stripe.com/payments/amazon-pay/accept-a-payment?payment-ui=checkout.

> Stripe can automatically present the relevant payment methods to your customers by evaluating currency, payment method restrictions, and other parameters.
>
> - Follow the [Accept a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md?payment-ui=checkout&ui=stripe-hosted) guide to build a Checkout integration that uses [dynamic payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods.md).

- If you don’t want to use dynamic payment methods, follow the steps below to manually configure the payment methods in your Checkout integration.

Amazon Pay is a [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#usage) payment method where customers are required to [authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#customer-actions) their payment. Customers are redirected from your website or app, authorize the payment with Amazon, then return to your website or app. You get [immediate notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#payment-notification) of whether the payment succeeded or failed.

## Determine compatibility

To support Amazon Pay payments, a Checkout Session must satisfy all of the following conditions:

- *Prices* (Prices define how much and how often to charge for products. This includes how much the product costs, what currency to use, and the interval if the price is for subscriptions) for all line items must be in the same currency.
  - If you have line items in different currencies, create separate Checkout Sessions for each currency.

## Accept a payment

> Build an integration to [accept a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md?integration=checkout) with Checkout before using this guide.

This guides you through enabling Amazon Pay and shows the differences between accepting payments using dynamic payment methods and manually configuring payment methods.

### Enable Amazon Pay as a payment method

When creating a new [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions.md), you need to:

1. Add `amazon_pay` to the list of `payment_method_types`.
1. Make sure all `line_items` use the same currency.

#### Stripe-hosted page

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  line_items: [
    {
      price_data: {
        currency: "usd",
        product_data: {
          name: "T-shirt",
        },
        unit_amount: 2000,
      },
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ],
  mode: "payment",
  payment_method_types: ["card", "amazon_pay"],
  success_url: "https://example.com/success",
});
```

#### Full embedded page

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  line_items: [
    {
      price_data: {
        currency: "usd",
        product_data: {
          name: "T-shirt",
        },
        unit_amount: 2000,
      },
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ],
  mode: "payment",
  payment_method_types: ["card", "amazon_pay"],
  return_url: "https://example.com/return",
  ui_mode: "embedded_page",
});
```

### Fulfill your orders

After accepting a payment, learn how to [fulfill orders](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment.md).

## Test your integration

When testing your Checkout integration, select Amazon Pay as the payment method and click the **Pay** button.

# Elements

> This is a Elements for when payment-ui is elements. View the full page at https://docs.stripe.com/payments/amazon-pay/accept-a-payment?payment-ui=elements.

This guide describes how to embed a custom Stripe payment form in your website or application using the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md). The Payment Element allows you to support Amazon Pay and other payment methods automatically. For more configurations and customizations, refer to the [Accept a Payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md) integration guide.

## Set up Stripe [Server-side]

First, you need a Stripe account. [Register now](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).

Use our official libraries for access to the Stripe API from your application:

#### Node.js

```bash
# Install with npm
npm install stripe --save
```

## Create a PaymentIntent [Server-side]

A [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md) is an object that represents your intent to collect payment from a customer and tracks the lifecycle of the payment process through each stage.

#### Manage payment methods from the Dashboard

You can manage payment methods from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Stripe handles the return of eligible payment methods based on factors such as the transaction’s amount, currency, and payment flow.

Create a PaymentIntent on your server with an amount and currency. Before creating the PaymentIntent, make sure to turn **Amazon Pay** on in the [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) page.

> Always decide how much to charge on the server side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents customers from being able to choose their own prices.

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 1099,
  currency: "usd",
  automatic_payment_methods: {
    enabled: true,
  },
});
```

#### List payment methods manually

If you don’t want to use the Dashboard or you want to manually specify payment methods, you can list them using the `payment_method_types` attribute.

Create a PaymentIntent on your server with an amount, currency, and a list of payment methods.

> Always decide how much to charge on the server side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents customers from being able to choose their own prices.

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 1099,
  currency: "usd",
  payment_method_types: ["amazon_pay"],
});
```

### Retrieve the client secret

The PaymentIntent includes a *client secret* (The client secret is a unique key returned from Stripe as part of a PaymentIntent. This key lets the client access important fields from the PaymentIntent (status, amount, currency) while hiding sensitive ones (metadata, customer)) that the client side uses to securely complete the payment process. You can use different approaches to pass the client secret to the client side.

#### Single-page application

Retrieve the client secret from an endpoint on your server, using the browser’s `fetch` function. This approach is best if your client side is a single-page application, particularly one built with a modern frontend framework like React. Create the server endpoint that serves the client secret:

#### Node.js

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/secret", async (req, res) => {
  const intent = // ... Fetch or create the PaymentIntent
    res.json({ client_secret: intent.client_secret });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Running on port 3000");
});
```

And then fetch the client secret with JavaScript on the client side:

```javascript
(async () => {
  const response = await fetch("/secret");
  const { client_secret: clientSecret } = await response.json();
  // Render the form using the clientSecret
})();
```

#### Server-side rendering

Pass the client secret to the client from your server. This approach works best if your application generates static content on the server before sending it to the browser.

Add the [client_secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret) in your checkout form. In your server-side code, retrieve the client secret from the PaymentIntent:

#### Node.js

```html
<form id="payment-form" data-secret="{{ client_secret }}">
  <div id="payment-element">
    <!-- Elements will create form elements here -->
  </div>

  <button id="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const expressHandlebars = require("express-handlebars");
const app = express();

app.engine(".hbs", expressHandlebars({ extname: ".hbs" }));
app.set("view engine", ".hbs");
app.set("views", "./views");

app.get("/checkout", async (req, res) => {
  const intent = // ... Fetch or create the PaymentIntent
    res.render("checkout", { client_secret: intent.client_secret });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Running on port 3000");
});
```

## Collect payment details [Client-side]

Collect payment details on the client with the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md). The Payment Element is a prebuilt UI component that simplifies collecting payment details for a variety of payment methods.

The Payment Element contains an iframe that securely sends payment information to Stripe over an HTTPS connection. Avoid placing the Payment Element within another iframe because some payment methods require redirecting to another page for payment confirmation.

If you choose to use an iframe and want to accept Apple Pay or Google Pay, the iframe must have the [allow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attr-allowpaymentrequest) attribute set to equal `"payment *"`.

The checkout page address must start with `https://` rather than `http://` for your integration to work. You can test your integration without using HTTPS, but remember to [enable it](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide.md#tls) when you’re ready to accept live payments.

#### HTML + JS

### Set up Stripe.js

The Payment Element is automatically available as a feature of Stripe.js. Include the Stripe.js script on your checkout page by adding it to the `head` of your HTML file. Always load Stripe.js directly from js.stripe.com to remain PCI compliant. Don’t include the script in a bundle or host a copy of it yourself.

```html
<head>
  <title>Checkout</title>
  <script src="https://js.stripe.com/dahlia/stripe.js"></script>
</head>
```

Create an instance of Stripe with the following JavaScript on your checkout page:

```javascript
// Set your publishable key: remember to change this to your live publishable key in production
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
const stripe = Stripe("<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>");
```

### Add the Payment Element to your payment page

The Payment Element needs a place to live on your payment page. Create an empty DOM node (container) with a unique ID in your payment form:

```html
<form id="payment-form">
  <div id="payment-element">
    <!-- Elements will create form elements here -->
  </div>
  <button id="submit">Submit</button>
  <div id="error-message">
    <!-- Display error message to your customers here -->
  </div>
</form>
```

When the previous form loads, create an instance of the Payment Element and mount it to the container DOM node. Pass the [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret) from the previous step into `options` when you create the [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create) instance:

Handle the client secret carefully because it can complete the charge. Don’t log it, embed it in URLs, or expose it to anyone but the customer.

```javascript
const options = {
  clientSecret: "{{CLIENT_SECRET}}",
  // Fully customizable with appearance API.
  appearance: {
    /*...*/
  },
};

// Set up Stripe.js and Elements to use in checkout form, passing the client secret obtained in a previous stepconst elements = stripe.elements(options);
// Optional: Autofill user's saved payment methods. If the customer's
// email is known when the page is loaded, you can pass the email
// to the linkAuthenticationElement on mount:
//
//   linkAuthenticationElement.mount("#link-authentication-element",  {
//     defaultValues: {
//       email: 'jenny.rosen@example.com',
//     }
//   })

// Create and mount the Payment Element
const paymentElementOptions = { layout: "accordion" };
const paymentElement = elements.create("payment", paymentElementOptions);
paymentElement.mount("#payment-element");
```

#### React

### Set up Stripe.js

Install [React Stripe.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stripe/react-stripe-js) and the [Stripe.js loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stripe/stripe-js) from the npm public registry:

```bash
npm install --save @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js
```

### Add and configure the Elements provider to your payment page

To use the Payment Element component, wrap your checkout page component in an [Elements provider](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/stripejs-react.md#elements-provider). Call `loadStripe` with your publishable key, and pass the returned `Promise` to the `Elements` provider. Also pass the [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret) from the previous step as `options` to the `Elements` provider.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { Elements } from "@stripe/react-stripe-js";
import { loadStripe } from "@stripe/stripe-js";

import CheckoutForm from "./CheckoutForm";

// Make sure to call `loadStripe` outside of a component’s render to avoid
// recreating the `Stripe` object on every render.
const stripePromise = loadStripe("<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>");

function App() {
  const options = {
    // passing the client secret obtained in step 3
    clientSecret: "{{CLIENT_SECRET}}",
    // Fully customizable with appearance API.
    appearance: {
      /*...*/
    },
  };

  return (
    <Elements stripe={stripePromise} options={options}>
      <CheckoutForm />
    </Elements>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

### Add the Payment Element component

Use the `PaymentElement` component to build your form:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {PaymentElement} from '@stripe/react-stripe-js';

const CheckoutForm = () => {
  return (
    <form>
      // Optional: Autofill user's saved payment methods. If the customer's
      // email is known when the page is loaded, you can pass the email
      // to the linkAuthenticationElement
      //
      // <LinkAuthenticationElement id="link-authentication-element"
        // Prefill the email field like so:
        // options={{defaultValues: {email: 'foo@bar.com'}}}
      // /><PaymentElement />
      <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default CheckoutForm;
```

## Submit the payment to Stripe [Client-side]

Use [stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment) to complete the payment using details from the Payment Element. Provide a [return_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create.md#create_payment_intent-return_url) to this function to indicate where Stripe should redirect the user after they complete the payment. Your user may be first redirected to an intermediate site, like a bank authorization page, before being redirected to the `return_url`. Card payments immediately redirect to the `return_url` when a payment is successful.

#### HTML + JS

```javascript
const form = document.getElementById("payment-form");

form.addEventListener("submit", async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const { error } = await stripe.confirmPayment({
    //`Elements` instance that was used to create the Payment Element
    elements,
    confirmParams: {
      return_url: "https://example.com/order/123/complete",
    },
  });

  if (error) {
    // This point will only be reached if there is an immediate error when
    // confirming the payment. Show error to your customer (for example, payment
    // details incomplete)
    const messageContainer = document.querySelector("#error-message");
    messageContainer.textContent = error.message;
  } else {
    // Your customer will be redirected to your `return_url`. For some payment
    // methods like iDEAL, your customer will be redirected to an intermediate
    // site first to authorize the payment, then redirected to the `return_url`.
  }
});
```

#### React

To call [stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment) from your payment form component, use the [useStripe](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/stripejs-react.md#usestripe-hook) and [useElements](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/stripejs-react.md#useelements-hook) hooks.

If you prefer traditional class components over hooks, you can instead use an [ElementsConsumer](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/stripejs-react.md#elements-consumer).

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import {
  useStripe,
  useElements,
  PaymentElement,
} from "@stripe/react-stripe-js";

const CheckoutForm = () => {
  const stripe = useStripe();
  const elements = useElements();

  const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState(null);

  const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    // We don't want to let default form submission happen here,
    // which would refresh the page.
    event.preventDefault();

    if (!stripe || !elements) {
      // Stripe.js hasn't yet loaded.
      // Make sure to disable form submission until Stripe.js has loaded.
      return;
    }
    const { error } = await stripe.confirmPayment({
      //`Elements` instance that was used to create the Payment Element
      elements,
      confirmParams: {
        return_url: "https://example.com/order/123/complete",
      },
    });

    if (error) {
      // This point will only be reached if there is an immediate error when
      // confirming the payment. Show error to your customer (for example, payment
      // details incomplete)
      setErrorMessage(error.message);
    } else {
      // Your customer will be redirected to your `return_url`. For some payment
      // methods like iDEAL, your customer will be redirected to an intermediate
      // site first to authorize the payment, then redirected to the `return_url`.
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <PaymentElement />
      <button disabled={!stripe}>Submit</button>
      {/* Show error message to your customers */}
      {errorMessage && <div>{errorMessage}</div>}
    </form>
  );
};

export default CheckoutForm;
```

Make sure the `return_url` corresponds to a page on your website that provides the status of the payment. When Stripe redirects the customer to the `return_url`, we provide the following URL query parameters:

| Parameter                      | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `payment_intent`               | The unique identifier for the `PaymentIntent`.                                                                                                |
| `payment_intent_client_secret` | The [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret) of the `PaymentIntent` object. |

> If you have tooling that tracks the customer’s browser session, you might need to add the `stripe.com` domain to the referrer exclude list. Redirects cause some tools to create new sessions, which prevents you from tracking the complete session.

Use one of the query parameters to retrieve the PaymentIntent. Inspect the [status of the PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paymentintents/lifecycle.md) to decide what to show your customers. You can also append your own query parameters when providing the `return_url`, which persist through the redirect process.

#### HTML + JS

```javascript
// Initialize Stripe.js using your publishable key
const stripe = Stripe("<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>");

// Retrieve the "payment_intent_client_secret" query parameter appended to
// your return_url by Stripe.js
const clientSecret = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get(
  "payment_intent_client_secret",
);

// Retrieve the PaymentIntent
stripe.retrievePaymentIntent(clientSecret).then(({ paymentIntent }) => {
  const message = document.querySelector("#message");

  // Inspect the PaymentIntent `status` to indicate the status of the payment
  // to your customer.
  //
  // Some payment methods will [immediately succeed or fail][0] upon
  // confirmation, while others will first enter a `processing` state.
  //
  // [0]: https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification
  switch (paymentIntent.status) {
    case "succeeded":
      message.innerText = "Success! Payment received.";
      break;

    case "processing":
      message.innerText =
        "Payment processing. We'll update you when payment is received.";
      break;

    case "requires_payment_method":
      message.innerText = "Payment failed. Please try another payment method.";
      // Redirect your user back to your payment page to attempt collecting
      // payment again
      break;

    default:
      message.innerText = "Something went wrong.";
      break;
  }
});
```

#### React

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useStripe } from "@stripe/react-stripe-js";

const PaymentStatus = () => {
  const stripe = useStripe();
  const [message, setMessage] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!stripe) {
      return;
    }

    // Retrieve the "payment_intent_client_secret" query parameter appended to
    // your return_url by Stripe.js
    const clientSecret = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get(
      "payment_intent_client_secret",
    );

    // Retrieve the PaymentIntent
    stripe.retrievePaymentIntent(clientSecret).then(({ paymentIntent }) => {
      // Inspect the PaymentIntent `status` to indicate the status of the payment
      // to your customer.
      //
      // Some payment methods will [immediately succeed or fail][0] upon
      // confirmation, while others will first enter a `processing` state.
      //
      // [0]: https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification
      switch (paymentIntent.status) {
        case "succeeded":
          setMessage("Success! Payment received.");
          break;

        case "processing":
          setMessage(
            "Payment processing. We'll update you when payment is received.",
          );
          break;

        case "requires_payment_method":
          // Redirect your user back to your payment page to attempt collecting
          // payment again
          setMessage("Payment failed. Please try another payment method.");
          break;

        default:
          setMessage("Something went wrong.");
          break;
      }
    });
  }, [stripe]);

  return message;
};

export default PaymentStatus;
```

## Redirect and authenticate transactions

Customers can authenticate Amazon Pay transactions in the browser. After calling `confirmPayment`, customers are redirected to Amazon Pay’s website to confirm their payment.

When confirmation is complete, customers are redirected to the `return_url`.

## Optional: Separate authorization and capture

You can separate authorization and capture to create a charge now, but capture funds later. Stripe cancels the PaymentIntent and sends a [payment_intent.canceled](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-payment_intent.canceled) event if the payment isn’t captured during the 7-day window.

If you know that you can’t capture the payment, we recommend [canceling the PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/refunds.md#cancel-payment) instead of waiting for the 7-day window to elapse.

### 1. Tell Stripe to authorize only

To indicate that you want separate authorization and capture, set [capture_method](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create.md#create_payment_intent-capture_method) to `manual` when creating the PaymentIntent. This parameter instructs Stripe to only authorize the amount on the customer’s Amazon Pay account.

```
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents \
  -u sk_test123: \
  -d amount=6000 \
  -d confirm=true \
  -d currency=usd \
  -d "payment_method_types[]"=amazon_pay \
  -d "payment_method_data[type]"=amazon_pay \
  -d capture_method=manual \
  --data-urlencode return_url="https://www.example.com/checkout/done"
```

### 2. Capture the funds

After the authorization succeeds, the [PaymentIntent status](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-status) transitions to `requires_capture`. To capture the authorized funds, make a PaymentIntent [capture request](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/capture.md).

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.capture(
  "{PAYMENT_INTENT_ID}",
);
```

The total authorized amount is captured by default. You can also specify `amount_to_capture` which can be less or equal to the total.

### (Optional) Cancel the authorization

If you need to cancel an authorization, you can [cancel the PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/cancel.md).

## Optional: Handle post-payment events

Stripe sends a [payment_intent.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-payment_intent.succeeded) event when the payment completes. Use the Dashboard, a custom *webhook* (A webhook is a real-time push notification sent to your application as a JSON payload through HTTPS requests), or a partner solution to receive these events and run actions, like sending an order confirmation email to your customer, logging the sale in a database, or starting a shipping workflow.

Listen for these events rather than waiting on a callback from the client. On the client, the customer could close the browser window or quit the app before the callback executes, and malicious clients could manipulate the response. Setting up your integration to listen for asynchronous events also helps you accept more payment methods in the future. Learn about the [differences between all supported payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide).

- **Handle events manually in the Dashboard**

  Use the Dashboard to [View your test payments in the Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments), send email receipts, handle payouts, or retry failed payments.

- **Build a custom webhook**

  [Build a custom webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/handling-payment-events.md#build-your-own-webhook) handler to listen for events and build custom asynchronous payment flows. Test and debug your webhook integration locally with the Stripe CLI.

- **Integrate a prebuilt app**

  Handle common business events, such as [automation](https://stripe.partners/?f_category=automation) or [marketing and sales](https://stripe.partners/?f_category=marketing-and-sales), by integrating a partner application.

## Test your integration

To test your integration, choose Amazon Pay as the payment method and tap **Pay**. In a sandbox, this redirects you to a test payment page where you can approve or decline the payment.

In live mode, tapping **Pay** redirects you to the Amazon Pay website—you don’t have the option to approve or decline the payment with Amazon Pay.

## Failed payments

If Amazon Pay declines the transaction for any reason, the [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object.md) is detached and the [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md) object’s status automatically transitions to `requires_payment_method`.

Other than a payment being declined, if an Amazon Pay [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md) has a status of `requires_action`, customers must complete the payment within 10 minutes after they’re redirected to Amazon. If no action is taken after 10 minutes, the [PaymentMethod](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_methods/object.md) is detached and the [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md) object’s status automatically transitions to `requires_payment_method`.

When this happens, the Payment Element renders error messages and instructs your customer to retry using a different payment method.

## Error codes

The following table details common error codes and recommended actions:

| Error Code                                                | Recommended Action                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

# Direct API

> This is a Direct API for when payment-ui is direct-api. View the full page at https://docs.stripe.com/payments/amazon-pay/accept-a-payment?payment-ui=direct-api.

Amazon Pay is a [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#usage) payment method where customers are required to [authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#customer-actions) their payment. Customers are redirected from your website or app, authorize the payment with Amazon, then return to your website or app. You get [immediate notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#payment-notification) of whether the payment succeeded or failed.

## Set up Stripe [Server-side]

[Create a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register) if you don’t already have one.

Use our official libraries for access to the Stripe API from your application:

#### Node.js

```bash
# Install with npm
npm install stripe --save
```

## Create a PaymentIntent [Server-side]

A [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md) is an object that represents your intent to collect payment from your customer and tracks the lifecycle of the payment process. Create a `PaymentIntent` on your server and specify the amount to collect and a [supported currency](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/amazon-pay.md#supported-currencies). If you have an existing [Payment Intents](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents.md) integration, add `amazon_pay` to the list of [payment method types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create.md#create_payment_intent-payment_method_types).

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  payment_method_types: ["amazon_pay"],
  amount: 1099,
  currency: "usd",
});
```

The `PaymentIntent` includes a *client secret* (The client secret is a unique key returned from Stripe as part of a PaymentIntent. This key lets the client access important fields from the PaymentIntent (status, amount, currency) while hiding sensitive ones (metadata, customer)). Send the client secret to your client to securely complete the payment process instead of passing the entire `PaymentIntent` object.

### Retrieve the client secret

The PaymentIntent includes a *client secret* (The client secret is a unique key returned from Stripe as part of a PaymentIntent. This key lets the client access important fields from the PaymentIntent (status, amount, currency) while hiding sensitive ones (metadata, customer)) that the client side uses to securely complete the payment process. You can use different approaches to pass the client secret to the client side.

#### Single-page application

Retrieve the client secret from an endpoint on your server, using the browser’s `fetch` function. This approach is best if your client side is a single-page application, particularly one built with a modern frontend framework like React. Create the server endpoint that serves the client secret:

#### Node.js

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/secret", async (req, res) => {
  const intent = // ... Fetch or create the PaymentIntent
    res.json({ client_secret: intent.client_secret });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Running on port 3000");
});
```

And then fetch the client secret with JavaScript on the client side:

```javascript
(async () => {
  const response = await fetch("/secret");
  const { client_secret: clientSecret } = await response.json();
  // Render the form using the clientSecret
})();
```

#### Server-side rendering

Pass the client secret to the client from your server. This approach works best if your application generates static content on the server before sending it to the browser.

Add the [client_secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret) in your checkout form. In your server-side code, retrieve the client secret from the PaymentIntent:

#### Node.js

```html
<form id="payment-form" data-secret="{{ client_secret }}">
  <div id="payment-element">
    <!-- Elements will create form elements here -->
  </div>

  <button id="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const expressHandlebars = require("express-handlebars");
const app = express();

app.engine(".hbs", expressHandlebars({ extname: ".hbs" }));
app.set("view engine", ".hbs");
app.set("views", "./views");

app.get("/checkout", async (req, res) => {
  const intent = // ... Fetch or create the PaymentIntent
    res.render("checkout", { client_secret: intent.client_secret });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Running on port 3000");
});
```

## Redirect to Amazon Pay [Client-side]

When a customer clicks to pay with Amazon Pay, use Stripe.js to submit the payment to Stripe. [Stripe.js](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/elements.md) is the foundational JavaScript library for building payment flows. It automatically handles complexities like the redirect described below, and enables you to extend your integration to other payment methods. Include the Stripe.js script on your checkout page by adding it to the `head` of your HTML file.

```html
<head>
  <title>Checkout</title>
  <script src="https://js.stripe.com/dahlia/stripe.js"></script>
</head>
```

Create an instance of Stripe.js with the following JavaScript on your checkout page.

```javascript
// Set your publishable key. Remember to change this to your live publishable key in production!
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
const stripe = Stripe("<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>");
```

Use the [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret) of the `PaymentIntent` and call `stripe.confirmPayment` to handle the Amazon Pay redirect. Add a `return_url` to determine where Stripe redirects the customer after they complete the payment.

```javascript
const form = document.getElementById("payment-form");

form.addEventListener("submit", async function (event) {
  event.preventDefault();

  // Set the clientSecret of the PaymentIntent
  const { error } = await stripe.confirmPayment({
    clientSecret: clientSecret,
    confirmParams: {
      payment_method_data: {
        type: "amazon_pay",
      },
      // Return URL where the customer should be redirected after the authorization
      return_url: `${window.location.href}`,
    },
  });

  if (error) {
    // Inform the customer that there was an error.
    const errorElement = document.getElementById("error-message");
    errorElement.textContent = result.error.message;
  }
});
```

The `return_url` corresponds to a page on your website that displays the result of the payment. You can determine what to display by [verifying the status](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-intents/verifying-status.md#checking-status) of the `PaymentIntent`. To verify the status, the Stripe redirect to the `return_url` includes the following URL query parameters. You can also append your own query parameters to the `return_url`. They persist throughout the redirect process.

| Parameter                      | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `payment_intent`               | The unique identifier for the `PaymentIntent`.                                                                                                |
| `payment_intent_client_secret` | The [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret) of the `PaymentIntent` object. |

## Optional: Handle post-payment events

Stripe sends a [payment_intent.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-payment_intent.succeeded) event when the payment completes. Use the Dashboard, a custom *webhook* (A webhook is a real-time push notification sent to your application as a JSON payload through HTTPS requests), or a partner solution to receive these events and run actions, like sending an order confirmation email to your customer, logging the sale in a database, or starting a shipping workflow.

Listen for these events rather than waiting on a callback from the client. On the client, the customer could close the browser window or quit the app before the callback executes, and malicious clients could manipulate the response. Setting up your integration to listen for asynchronous events also helps you accept more payment methods in the future. Learn about the [differences between all supported payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide).

### Receive events and run business actions

There are a few options for receiving and running business actions.

#### Manually

Use the Stripe Dashboard to view all your Stripe payments, send email receipts, handle payouts, or retry failed payments.

- [View your test payments in the Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments)

#### Custom code

Build a webhook handler to listen for events and build custom asynchronous payment flows. Test and debug your webhook integration locally with the Stripe CLI.

- [Build a custom webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/handling-payment-events.md#build-your-own-webhook)

#### Prebuilt apps

Handle common business events, like [automation](https://stripe.partners/?f_category=automation) or [marketing and sales](https://stripe.partners/?f_category=marketing-and-sales), by integrating a partner application.

## Supported currencies

You can create Amazon Pay payments in any of the supported currencies, regardless of the country your business operates in with the exception of the US.

| Country                                                                                                                                                                   | Currency                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States | `aud`, `gbp`, `dkk`, `eur`, `hkd`, `jpy`, `nzd`, `nok`, `zar`, `sek`, `chf`, `usd` |

# iOS

> This is a iOS for when payment-ui is mobile and platform is ios. View the full page at https://docs.stripe.com/payments/amazon-pay/accept-a-payment?payment-ui=mobile&platform=ios.

We recommend you use the [Mobile Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md?=ios), an embeddable payment form, to add Amazon Pay and other payment methods to your integration with the least amount of effort.

Amazon Pay is a [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#usage) payment method where customers are required to [authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#customer-actions) their payment. Customers are redirected from your app, authorize the payment with Amazon, then return to your app. You get [immediate notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#payment-notification) of whether the payment succeeded or failed.

## Set up Stripe [Server-side] [Client-side]

First, you need a Stripe account. [Register now](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).

> For details on the latest SDK release and past versions, see the [Releases](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios/releases) page on GitHub. To receive notifications when a new release is published, [watch releases](https://help.github.com/en/articles/watching-and-unwatching-releases-for-a-repository#watching-releases-for-a-repository) for the repository.

Configure the SDK with your Stripe [publishable key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) on app start. This enables your app to make requests to the Stripe API.

#### Swift

```swift
import UIKitimportStripePaymentsUI

@main
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {StripeAPI.defaultPublishableKey = "<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>"
        // do any other necessary launch configuration
        return true
    }
}
```

> Use your [test keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#obtain-api-keys) while you test and develop, and your [live mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#test-live-modes) keys when you publish your app.

## Create a PaymentIntent [Server-side] [Client-side]

### Server-side

A [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md) is an object that represents your intent to collect payment from a customer and tracks the lifecycle of the payment process through each stage.

#### Manage payment methods in the Dashboard

You can manage payment methods in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Stripe handles the return of eligible payment methods based on factors such as the transaction’s amount, currency, and payment flow.

Create a PaymentIntent on your server with an amount and currency. Before creating the PaymentIntent, make sure to turn **Amazon Pay** on in the [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) page.

> Always decide how much to charge on the server-side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents customers from being able to choose their own prices.

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 1099,
  currency: "usd",
  automatic_payment_methods: {
    enabled: true,
  },
});
```

#### List payment methods manually

If you don’t want to use the Dashboard or you want to manually specify payment methods, you can list them using the `payment_method_types` attribute.

Create a PaymentIntent on your server with an amount, currency, and a list of payment methods.

> Always decide how much to charge on the server-side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents customers from being able to choose their own prices.

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 1099,
  currency: "usd",
  payment_method_types: ["amazon_pay"],
});
```

### Client-side

On the client, request a PaymentIntent from your server and store its *client secret* (The client secret is a unique key returned from Stripe as part of a PaymentIntent. This key lets the client access important fields from the PaymentIntent (status, amount, currency) while hiding sensitive ones (metadata, customer)).

#### Swift

```swift
class CheckoutViewController: UIViewController {
    var paymentIntentClientSecret: String?

    // ...continued from previous step

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        // ...continued from previous step
        startCheckout()
    }

    func startCheckout() {
        // Request a PaymentIntent from your server and store its client secret
        // Click View full sample to see a complete implementation
    }
}
```

## Submit the payment to Stripe [Client-side]

When a customer taps to pay with Amazon Pay, confirm the `PaymentIntent` to complete the payment. Configure an `STPPaymentIntentParams` object with the `PaymentIntent` [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret).

The client secret is different from your API keys that authenticate Stripe API requests. Handle it carefully because it can complete the charge. Don’t log it, embed it in URLs, or expose it to anyone but the customer.

### Set up a return URL

The iOS SDK presents a webview in your app to complete the Amazon Pay payment. When authentication is finished, the webview can automatically dismiss itself instead of having your customer close it. To enable this behavior, configure a custom URL scheme or universal link and set up your app delegate to forward the URL to the SDK.

#### Swift

```swift
// This method handles opening custom URL schemes (for example, "your-app://stripe-redirect")
func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplication.OpenURLOptionsKey: Any] = [:]) -> Bool {
    let stripeHandled = StripeAPI.handleURLCallback(with: url)
    if (stripeHandled) {
        return true
    } else {
        // This was not a Stripe url – handle the URL normally as you would
    }
    return false
}

// This method handles opening universal link URLs (for example, "https://example.com/stripe_ios_callback")
func application(_ application: UIApplication, continue userActivity: NSUserActivity, restorationHandler: @escaping ([UIUserActivityRestoring]?) -> Void) -> Bool {
    if userActivity.activityType == NSUserActivityTypeBrowsingWeb {
        if let url = userActivity.webpageURL {
            let stripeHandled = StripeAPI.handleURLCallback(with: url)
            if (stripeHandled) {
                return true
            } else {
                // This was not a Stripe url – handle the URL normally as you would
            }
        }
    }
    return false
}
```

Pass the URL as the `return_url` when you confirm the PaymentIntent. After webview-based authentication finishes, Stripe redirects the user to the `return_url`.

### Confirm the Amazon Pay payment

Complete the payment by calling `STPPaymentHandler.confirmPayment`. This presents a webview where the customer can complete the payment with Amazon Pay. After completion, Stripe calls the completion block with the result of the payment.

#### Swift

```swift
let paymentIntentParams = STPPaymentIntentParams(clientSecret: paymentIntentClientSecret)

// Amazon Pay doesn't require additional parameters so we only need to pass the initialized
// STPPaymentMethodAmazonPayParams instance to STPPaymentMethodParams
let amazonPay = STPPaymentMethodAmazonPayParams()
let paymentMethodParams = STPPaymentMethodParams(amazonPay: amazonPay, billingDetails: nil, metadata: nil)

paymentIntentParams.paymentMethodParams = paymentMethodParams
paymentIntentParams.returnURL = "payments-example://stripe-redirect"

STPPaymentHandler.shared().confirmPayment(paymentIntentParams,
                                          with: self)
{ (handlerStatus, paymentIntent, error) in
    switch handlerStatus {
    case .succeeded:
        // Payment succeeded
        // ...

    case .canceled:
        // Payment canceled
        // ...

    case .failed:
        // Payment failed
        // ...

    @unknown default:
        fatalError()
    }
}
```

## Optional: Handle post-payment events

Stripe sends a [payment_intent.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-payment_intent.succeeded) event when the payment completes. Use the Dashboard, a custom *webhook* (A webhook is a real-time push notification sent to your application as a JSON payload through HTTPS requests), or a partner solution to receive these events and run actions, like sending an order confirmation email to your customer, logging the sale in a database, or starting a shipping workflow.

Listen for these events rather than waiting on a callback from the client. On the client, the customer could close the browser window or quit the app before the callback executes, and malicious clients could manipulate the response. Setting up your integration to listen for asynchronous events also helps you accept more payment methods in the future. Learn about the [differences between all supported payment methods](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide).

- **Handle events manually in the Dashboard**

  Use the Dashboard to [View your test payments in the Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments), send email receipts, handle payouts, or retry failed payments.

- **Build a custom webhook**

  [Build a custom webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks/handling-payment-events.md#build-your-own-webhook) handler to listen for events and build custom asynchronous payment flows. Test and debug your webhook integration locally with the Stripe CLI.

- **Integrate a prebuilt app**

  Handle common business events, such as [automation](https://stripe.partners/?f_category=automation) or [marketing and sales](https://stripe.partners/?f_category=marketing-and-sales), by integrating a partner application.

# Android

> This is a Android for when payment-ui is mobile and platform is android. View the full page at https://docs.stripe.com/payments/amazon-pay/accept-a-payment?payment-ui=mobile&platform=android.

We recommend you use the [Mobile Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md?payment-ui=mobile&platform=android), an embeddable payment form, to add Amazon Pay and other payment methods to your integration with the least amount of effort.

Amazon Pay is a [single-use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#usage) payment method where customers are required to [authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#customer-actions) their payment. Customers are redirected from your app, authorize the payment with Amazon, then return to your app. You get [immediate notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#payment-notification) of whether the payment succeeded or failed.

## Set up Stripe [Server-side] [Client-side]

First, you need a Stripe account. [Register now](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).

### Server-side

This integration requires endpoints on your server that talk to the Stripe API. Use the official libraries for access to the Stripe API from your server:

#### Node.js

```bash
# Install with npm
npm install stripe --save
```

### Client-side

The [Stripe Android SDK](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android) is open source and [fully documented](https://stripe.dev/stripe-android/).

To install the SDK, add `stripe-android` to the `dependencies` block of your [app/build.gradle](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/dependencies) file:

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("com.android.application")
}

android { ... }

dependencies {
  // ...

  // Stripe Android SDK
  implementation("com.stripe:stripe-android:23.7.0")
  // Include the financial connections SDK to support US bank account as a payment method
  implementation("com.stripe:financial-connections:23.7.0")
}
```

> For details on the latest SDK release and past versions, see the [Releases](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android/releases) page on GitHub. To receive notifications when a new release is published, [watch releases for the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/configuring-notifications#configuring-your-watch-settings-for-an-individual-repository).

Configure the SDK with your Stripe [publishable key](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys) so that it can make requests to the Stripe API, such as in your `Application` subclass:

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
import com.stripe.android.PaymentConfiguration

class MyApp : Application() {
    override fun onCreate() {
        super.onCreate()
        PaymentConfiguration.init(
            applicationContext,
            "<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>"
        )
    }
}
```

> Use your [test keys](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#obtain-api-keys) while you test and develop, and your [live mode](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#test-live-modes) keys when you publish your app.

Stripe samples also use [OkHttp](https://github.com/square/okhttp) and [GSON](https://github.com/google/gson) to make HTTP requests to a server.

## Create a PaymentIntent [Server-side] [Client-side]

### Server-side

A [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md) is an object that represents your intent to collect payment from a customer and tracks the lifecycle of the payment process through each stage.

#### Manage payment methods in the Dashboard

You can manage payment methods in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Stripe handles the return of eligible payment methods based on factors such as the transaction’s amount, currency, and payment flow.

Create a PaymentIntent on your server with an amount and currency. Before creating the PaymentIntent, make sure to turn **Amazon Pay** on in the [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) page.

> Always decide how much to charge on the server-side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents customers from being able to choose their own prices.

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 1099,
  currency: "usd",
  automatic_payment_methods: {
    enabled: true,
  },
});
```

#### List payment methods manually

If you don’t want to use the Dashboard or you want to manually specify payment methods, you can list them using the `payment_method_types` attribute.

Create a PaymentIntent on your server with an amount, currency, and a list of payment methods.

> Always decide how much to charge on the server-side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents customers from being able to choose their own prices.

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 1099,
  currency: "usd",
  payment_method_types: ["amazon_pay"],
});
```

### Client-side

On the client, request a PaymentIntent from your server and store its *client secret* (The client secret is a unique key returned from Stripe as part of a PaymentIntent. This key lets the client access important fields from the PaymentIntent (status, amount, currency) while hiding sensitive ones (metadata, customer)).

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
class CheckoutActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

  private lateinit var paymentIntentClientSecret: String

  override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
      super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
      // ...
      startCheckout()
  }

  private fun startCheckout() {
      // Request a PaymentIntent from your server and store its client secret in paymentIntentClientSecret
      // Click View full sample to see a complete implementation
  }
}
```

## Submit the payment to Stripe [Client-side]

When a customer taps to pay with Amazon Pay, confirm the `PaymentIntent` to complete the payment. Configure a `ConfirmPaymentIntentParams` object with the `PaymentIntent` [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret).

The client secret is different from your API keys that authenticate Stripe API requests. Handle it carefully because it can complete the charge. Don’t log it, embed it in URLs, or expose it to anyone but the customer.

### Confirm Amazon Pay payment

Complete the payment by calling [PaymentLauncher confirm](https://stripe.dev/stripe-android/payments-core/com.stripe.android.payments.paymentlauncher/-payment-launcher/confirm.html). This redirects the customer to Amazon, where they can complete the payment with Amazon Pay. After completion, Stripe calls the `PaymentResultCallback` you set with the result of the payment.

#### Kotlin

```kotlin
class CheckoutActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    // ...

    private val paymentLauncher: PaymentLauncher by lazy {
        val paymentConfiguration = PaymentConfiguration.getInstance(applicationContext)
        PaymentLauncher.create(
            activity = this,
            publishableKey = paymentConfiguration.publishableKey,
            stripeAccountId = paymentConfiguration.stripeAccountId,
            callback = ::onPaymentResult,
        )
    }

    // …

    private fun startCheckout() {
        // ...

        val amazonPayParams = PaymentMethodCreateParams.createAmazonPay()

        val confirmParams = ConfirmPaymentIntentParams
            .createWithPaymentMethodCreateParams(
                paymentMethodCreateParams = amazonPayParams,
                clientSecret = paymentIntentClientSecret,
            )

        paymentLauncher.confirm(confirmParams)
    }

    private fun onPaymentResult(paymentResult: PaymentResult) {
        // Handle the payment result…
    }
}
```

## Optional: Handle post-payment events

Stripe sends a [payment_intent.succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-payment_intent.succeeded) event when the payment completes. Use the Dashboard, a custom *webhook* (A webhook is a real-time push notification sent to your application as a JSON payload through HTTPS requests), or a partner solution to receive these events and run actions, like sending an order confirmation email to your customer, logging the sale in a database, or starting a shipping workflow.

## Test your integration

Test your Amazon Pay integration with your test API keys by viewing the redirect page. You can test the successful payment case by authenticating the payment on the redirect page. The [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md) transitions from `requires_action` to `succeeded`.

To test the case where the user fails to authenticate, use your test API keys and view the redirect page. On the redirect page, click **Fail test payment**. The [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md) transitions from `requires_action` to `requires_payment_method`.

For manual capture PaymentIntents in a testing environment, the uncaptured [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md) auto-expires 7 days after successful authorization.

The payment flow that you simulate in a testing environment differs from the payment flow in live mode. In live mode, tapping **Pay** redirects you to the Amazon mobile application.
