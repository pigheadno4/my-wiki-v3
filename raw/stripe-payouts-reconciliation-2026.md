# Payout reconciliation

Know which transactions are included in a given payout.

Sending funds from your Stripe available balance to your bank account generates a payout object. Automatic payouts occur routinely according to your [payout schedule](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts.md#payout-schedule) and can include funds from multiple transactions.

Stripe provides the following ways to review the transactions included in an automatic payout:

- Open a payout in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payouts).
- View or download the [payout reconciliation report](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/payout-reconciliation.md).
- Retrieve the payout details through the Stripe API as documented in this guide.

> #### Reconciliation for manual payouts
>
> You control the timing and amount of manual payouts, so Stripe can’t identify which transactions are included in each payout. You’re responsible for reconciling payouts you create against your transaction history.

## Find the Payout ID

You need a payout’s `id` (`po_xxx`) to retrieve information about the payout’s transactions. To get it:

- Listen to the `payout.reconciliation_completed` webhook event.
- Call [List Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/list.md) to review a list of payouts.
- Retrieve it from your own database.

You could [retrieve the Payout](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/retrieve.md) to access its properties, but this won’t include the individual transactions that make up the total amount.

```json
{
  "id": "po_001",
  "amount": 8000,
  "currency": "usd",
  "status": "paid",
  ...
}
```

## List BalanceTransactions

Every funds movement in or out of your Stripe account creates a [BalanceTransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions.md). Pass the payout ID in your [list BalanceTransaction](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions/list.md) request to filter the results by only transactions associated with that payout.

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const balanceTransactions = await stripe.balanceTransactions.list({
  payout: "po_xxx",
});
```

If you need more results than the default 10, set the [`limit`](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance_transactions/list.md#balance_transaction_list-limit) parameter in the request or use Stripe’s [auto-pagination](https://docs.stripe.com/api/pagination/auto.md).

The response returns an array of BalanceTransactions objects for the specified payout:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "txn_001",
      "amount": 10000,
      "type": "charge",
      "source": "ch_001",
      ...
    },
    {
      "id": "txn_002",
      "amount": -2000,
      "type": "refund",
      "source": "re_001",
      ...
    },
    ...
```

The `type` property identifies the underlying activity that generated the transaction. for example:

- `charge`: A payment from your customer.
- `refund`: Funds you returned to your customer.
- `stripe_fee`: A Stripe fee you paid.
- `payout`: The payout itself, which is also a transaction that moved funds from your Stripe account to your bank account.

See [balance transaction types](https://docs.stripe.com/reports/balance-transaction-types.md#types) for a complete list.

## Expand balance transaction resources

The `source` property of each BalanceTransaction identifies the underlying object representing the transaction type, such as `ch_xxx` for a Charge or `re_xxx` for a Refund. To retrieve these objects without making extra API calls, update the previous code using [expand](https://docs.stripe.com/expand.md).

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const balanceTransactions = await stripe.balanceTransactions.list({
  payout: "po_xxx",
  expand: ["data.source"],
});
```

The response contains the expanded `source` object for each BalanceTransaction in the payout:

```json
{
  "object": "list",
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "txn_001",
      "amount": 10000,
      "type": "charge",
      "source": {
        "id": "ch_001",
        "amount": 10000,
        "metadata": { ... },
        ...
      },
      ...
    },
    {
      "id": "txn_002",
      "amount": -2000,
      "type": "refund",
      "source": {
        "id": "re_001",
        "amount": 2000,
        "reason": "requested_by_customer",
        ...
      },
      ...
```

Use the following code to access the `source` object properties such as `id` and `amount`.

#### Node.js

```javascript
balanceTransactions.data.map((txn) => {
  const obj = txn.source;
  console.log(obj.id, obj.amount);
});
```
