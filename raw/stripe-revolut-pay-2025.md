# Revolut Pay payments

Learn about Revolut Pay, a digital wallet payment method used in the United Kingdom and the European Union.

Revolut Pay, developed by [Revolut](https://www.revolut.com/business/revolut-pay/), a global finance app, is a digital wallet payment method. Revolut Pay uses the customer’s stored balance or cards to fund the payment, and offers the option for non-Revolut customers to save their details after their first purchase.

When customers select Revolut Pay as their payment method, Stripe redirects them to Revolut Pay’s website, where they have to authenticate with their account details or checkout as a first time user. After authenticating, Revolut Pay redirects customers back to your website.

## Payment flow

Below is a demonstration of the Revolut Pay payment flow from your checkout page:
![Revolut Pay payment flow demo](assets/stripe-revolut-pay-flow.mp4)

## Get started

You don’t have to integrate Revolut Pay and other payment methods individually. If you use our front-end products, Stripe automatically determines the most relevant payment methods to display. Go to the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) and enable Revolut Pay. To get started with one of our hosted UIs, follow a quickstart:

- [Checkout](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/quickstart.md): Our prebuilt, hosted checkout page.
- [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/quickstart-checkout-sessions.md): Our drop-in UI components.

### Other payment products

The following Stripe products also let you add Revolut Pay from the Dashboard:

- [Invoicing](https://docs.stripe.com/invoicing/no-code-guide.md)
- [Payment Links](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links.md)
- [Subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/overview.md)

If your integration requires manually listing payment methods, learn how to [manually configure Revolut Pay as a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/revolut-pay/accept-a-payment.md).

Check out the Revolut Pay [sample on GitHub](https://github.com/stripe-samples/accept-a-payment).

## Refunds

Revolut Pay supports full and partial refunds. The refund period is up to 180 days after the purchase. Refunds for Revolut Pay payments are asynchronous and take up to 5 minutes to complete. We notify you of the final refund status using the `refund.updated` or `refund.failed` *webhook* (A webhook is a real-time push notification sent to your application as a JSON payload through HTTPS requests) event. When a refund succeeds, the status of the [Refund object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/refunds/object.md) transitions to `succeeded`. If a refund fails, the status of the Refund object transitions to `failed` and we return the amount to your Stripe balance. You then need to arrange an alternative way of providing a refund.

## Disputes

Customers must authenticate Revolut Pay payments by logging into their Revolut account. This requirement helps reduce the risk of fraud or unrecognized payments. With [Revolut’s Buyer Protection Policy](https://www.revolut.com/legal/buyer-protection-policy/), customers can file a dispute, which can result in a chargeback and funds being withdrawn from your Stripe account.

Customers have up to 120 calendar days from the date of purchase to file a dispute. The dispute process works like this:

- After the customer initiates a dispute, Stripe notifies you through email, the Stripe Dashboard, and an API `charge.dispute.created` event (if your integration is set up to receive [webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/webhooks.md)).

- Stripe holds back the disputed amount from your balance until Revolut resolves the dispute.

- Stripe requests that you upload compelling evidence that you fulfilled the purchase order [using the Stripe Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding.md#respond). This evidence can include:
  - A received return confirmation (for shipped goods returned from the customer to you)
  - The tracking ID
  - The shipping date
  - A record of purchase for intangible goods, such as IP address or email receipt
  - A record of purchase for services or physical goods, such as phone number or proof of receipt

  This information helps Revolut determine if a dispute is valid or if they need to reject it. Make sure the evidence you provide contains as much detail as possible from what the customer provided at checkout. You must submit the requested information within 14 calendar days. Revolut makes a decision within 35 calendar days of evidence submission. If Revolut resolves the dispute in your favor, Stripe returns the disputed amount to your Stripe balance. If Revolut rules in favor of the customer, the balance charge becomes permanent.

> If you prefer to handle disputes programmatically, you can [respond to disputes using the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api.md).

## Supported currencies

You can create Revolut Pay payments in the currencies that map to your country. Currently, we support `gbp`, `eur`, `ron`, `huf`, `pln`, and `dkk`. The default local currency for Revolut Pay UK customers is `gbp` and for other EU customers it’s `eur`.
