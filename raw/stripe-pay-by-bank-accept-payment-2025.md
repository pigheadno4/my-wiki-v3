# Pay by Bank payments

Learn how to accept Pay by Bank payments.

# Checkout

> This is a Checkout for when payment-ui is checkout. View the full page at https://docs.stripe.com/payments/pay-by-bank/accept-a-payment?payment-ui=checkout.

Pay by Bank is a [single use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#usage) payment method where customers must [authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#customer-actions) their payment with their bank app or web portal. Pay by Bank redirects customers from your website, authorizes the payment, and returns them to your website. You get [immediate notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#payment-notification) on whether the payment succeeded or failed.

> Stripe can automatically present the relevant payment methods to your customers by evaluating currency, payment method restrictions, and other parameters.
>
> - Follow the [Accept a payment](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/accept-a-payment.md?payment-ui=checkout&ui=stripe-hosted) guide to build a Checkout integration that uses [dynamic payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods.md).

- If you don’t want to use dynamic payment methods, follow the steps below to manually configure the payment methods in your Checkout integration.

## Determine compatibility

**Supported business locations**: DE, GB

**Supported currencies**: `eur, gbp`

**Presentment currencies**: `eur, gbp`

**Payment mode**: Yes

**Setup mode**: No

**Subscription mode**: No

A Checkout Session must satisfy all of the following conditions to support Pay by Bank payments:

- *Prices* (Prices define how much and how often to charge for products. This includes how much the product costs, what currency to use, and the interval if the price is for subscriptions) for all line items must be in the same currency. If you have line items in different currencies, create separate Checkout Sessions for each currency.
- You can only use one-time line items. Recurring *subscription* (A Subscription represents the product details associated with the plan that your customer subscribes to. Allows you to charge the customer on a recurring basis) pricing plans aren’t supported.

To join the private preview for France, Germany, and Ireland availability, see [Pay by Bank payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/pay-by-bank.md).

## Enable Pay by Bank as a payment method

This guides you through enabling Pay by Bank and shows the differences between accepting payments using dynamic payment methods and manually configuring payment methods.

To create a new [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions.md):

1. Add `pay_by_bank` to the list of `payment_method_types`.
1. Make sure all your `line_items` use the `gbp` currency.
1. Add a message in [payment_method_options.pay_by_bank.statement_descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-payment_method_options-pay_by_bank). This descriptor can be your business name or some other text to help your customer identify the transaction. Your customer’s bank statement includes this message.

### Fulfill your orders

After accepting a payment, learn how to [fulfill orders](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment.md).

## Test your integration

To test your Checkout integration, select Pay by Bank as the payment method and click the **Pay** button.

- Click **Authorize test payment** to test the case when the payment is successful.
- Click **Fail test payment** to test the case when the customer fails to authenticate.

## Handle refunds and disputes

The refund period for Pay by Bank is up to 730 days (2 years) after the original payment. A refund generally arrives by the next business day but can take up to 7 days to appear as successful. There is no dispute process, customers authenticate with their bank.

# Elements

> This is a Elements for when payment-ui is elements. View the full page at https://docs.stripe.com/payments/pay-by-bank/accept-a-payment?payment-ui=elements.

Pay by Bank is a [single use](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#usage) payment method where customers must [authenticate](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#customer-actions) their payment with their bank app or web portal. Pay by Bank redirects customers from your website, authorizes the payment, and returns them to your website. You get [immediate notification](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods.md#payment-notification) on whether the payment succeeded or failed.

This guide teaches you how to embed a custom Stripe payment form in your website or application using the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md). The Payment Element allows you to support Pay by Bank and other payment methods automatically. For advanced configurations and customizations, see [Build an advanced payments integration](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/advanced.md).

## Set up Stripe [Server-side]

If you haven’t already, [create a Stripe account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register).

Use our official libraries for access to the Stripe API from your application:

#### Node.js

```bash
# Install with npm
npm install stripe --save
```

## Create a PaymentIntent [Server-side]

Stripe uses a [PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents.md) object to represent your intent to collect payment from a customer, tracking charge attempts and payment state changes.

#### Manage payment methods from the Dashboard

Create a PaymentIntent on your server with an amount and currency. You can manage payment methods from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). Stripe handles the return of eligible payment methods based on factors such as the transaction’s amount, currency, and payment flow. Before creating the Payment Intent, make sure to turn **Swish** on in the [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) page.

Always decide how much to charge on the server side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents malicious customers from being able to choose their own prices.

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 1099,
  currency: "usd",
  automatic_payment_methods: {
    enabled: true,
  },
});
```

#### List payment methods manually

If you don’t want to use the Dashboard or want to manually specify payment methods, you can list them using the `payment_method_types` attribute.

Create a PaymentIntent on your server with an amount, currency, and a list of payment methods. Always decide how much to charge on the server side, a trusted environment, as opposed to the client. This prevents malicious customers from being able to choose their own prices.

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
  amount: 1000,
  currency: "gbp",
  payment_method_types: ["pay_by_bank"],
});
```

### Retrieve the client secret

The PaymentIntent includes a *client secret* (The client secret is a unique key returned from Stripe as part of a PaymentIntent. This key lets the client access important fields from the PaymentIntent (status, amount, currency) while hiding sensitive ones (metadata, customer)) that the client side uses to securely complete the payment process. You can use different approaches to pass the client secret to the client side.

#### Single-page application

Retrieve the client secret from an endpoint on your server, using the browser’s `fetch` function. This approach is best if your client side is a single-page application, particularly one built with a modern frontend framework like React. Create the server endpoint that serves the client secret:

#### Node.js

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const app = express();

app.get("/secret", async (req, res) => {
  const intent = // ... Fetch or create the PaymentIntent
    res.json({ client_secret: intent.client_secret });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Running on port 3000");
});
```

And then fetch the client secret with JavaScript on the client side:

```javascript
(async () => {
  const response = await fetch("/secret");
  const { client_secret: clientSecret } = await response.json();
  // Render the form using the clientSecret
})();
```

#### Server-side rendering

Pass the client secret to the client from your server. This approach works best if your application generates static content on the server before sending it to the browser.

Add the [client_secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret) in your checkout form. In your server-side code, retrieve the client secret from the PaymentIntent:

#### Node.js

```html
<form id="payment-form" data-secret="{{ client_secret }}">
  <div id="payment-element">
    <!-- Elements will create form elements here -->
  </div>

  <button id="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const expressHandlebars = require("express-handlebars");
const app = express();

app.engine(".hbs", expressHandlebars({ extname: ".hbs" }));
app.set("view engine", ".hbs");
app.set("views", "./views");

app.get("/checkout", async (req, res) => {
  const intent = // ... Fetch or create the PaymentIntent
    res.render("checkout", { client_secret: intent.client_secret });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Running on port 3000");
});
```

## Collect payment details [Client-side]

Collect payment details on the client with the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md). The Payment Element is a prebuilt UI component that simplifies collecting payment details for a variety of payment methods.

The Payment Element contains an iframe that securely sends payment information to Stripe over an HTTPS connection. Avoid placing the Payment Element within another iframe because some payment methods require redirecting to another page for payment confirmation.

If you choose to use an iframe and want to accept Apple Pay or Google Pay, the iframe must have the [allow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attr-allowpaymentrequest) attribute set to equal `"payment *"`.

The checkout page address must start with `https://` rather than `http://` for your integration to work. You can test your integration without using HTTPS, but remember to [enable it](https://docs.stripe.com/security/guide.md#tls) when you’re ready to accept live payments.

#### HTML + JS

### Set up Stripe.js

The Payment Element is automatically available as a feature of Stripe.js. Include the Stripe.js script on your checkout page by adding it to the `head` of your HTML file. Always load Stripe.js directly from js.stripe.com to remain PCI compliant. Don’t include the script in a bundle or host a copy of it yourself.

```html
<head>
  <title>Checkout</title>
  <script src="https://js.stripe.com/dahlia/stripe.js"></script>
</head>
```

Create an instance of Stripe with the following JavaScript on your checkout page:

```javascript
// Set your publishable key: remember to change this to your live publishable key in production
// See your keys here: https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
const stripe = Stripe("<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>");
```

### Add the Payment Element to your payment page

The Payment Element needs a place to live on your payment page. Create an empty DOM node (container) with a unique ID in your payment form:

```html
<form id="payment-form">
  <div id="payment-element">
    <!-- Elements will create form elements here -->
  </div>
  <button id="submit">Submit</button>
  <div id="error-message">
    <!-- Display error message to your customers here -->
  </div>
</form>
```

When the previous form loads, create an instance of the Payment Element and mount it to the container DOM node. Pass the [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret) from the previous step into `options` when you create the [Elements](https://docs.stripe.com/js/elements_object/create) instance:

Handle the client secret carefully because it can complete the charge. Don’t log it, embed it in URLs, or expose it to anyone but the customer.

```javascript
const options = {
  clientSecret: "{{CLIENT_SECRET}}",
  // Fully customizable with appearance API.
  appearance: {
    /*...*/
  },
};

// Set up Stripe.js and Elements to use in checkout form, passing the client secret obtained in a previous stepconst elements = stripe.elements(options);
// Optional: Autofill user's saved payment methods. If the customer's
// email is known when the page is loaded, you can pass the email
// to the linkAuthenticationElement on mount:
//
//   linkAuthenticationElement.mount("#link-authentication-element",  {
//     defaultValues: {
//       email: 'jenny.rosen@example.com',
//     }
//   })

// Create and mount the Payment Element
const paymentElementOptions = { layout: "accordion" };
const paymentElement = elements.create("payment", paymentElementOptions);
paymentElement.mount("#payment-element");
```

#### React

### Set up Stripe.js

Install [React Stripe.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stripe/react-stripe-js) and the [Stripe.js loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stripe/stripe-js) from the npm public registry:

```bash
npm install --save @stripe/react-stripe-js @stripe/stripe-js
```

### Add and configure the Elements provider to your payment page

To use the Payment Element component, wrap your checkout page component in an [Elements provider](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/stripejs-react.md#elements-provider). Call `loadStripe` with your publishable key, and pass the returned `Promise` to the `Elements` provider. Also pass the [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret) from the previous step as `options` to the `Elements` provider.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { Elements } from "@stripe/react-stripe-js";
import { loadStripe } from "@stripe/stripe-js";

import CheckoutForm from "./CheckoutForm";

// Make sure to call `loadStripe` outside of a component’s render to avoid
// recreating the `Stripe` object on every render.
const stripePromise = loadStripe("<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>");

function App() {
  const options = {
    // passing the client secret obtained in step 3
    clientSecret: "{{CLIENT_SECRET}}",
    // Fully customizable with appearance API.
    appearance: {
      /*...*/
    },
  };

  return (
    <Elements stripe={stripePromise} options={options}>
      <CheckoutForm />
    </Elements>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

### Add the Payment Element component

Use the `PaymentElement` component to build your form:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import {PaymentElement} from '@stripe/react-stripe-js';

const CheckoutForm = () => {
  return (
    <form>
      // Optional: Autofill user's saved payment methods. If the customer's
      // email is known when the page is loaded, you can pass the email
      // to the linkAuthenticationElement
      //
      // <LinkAuthenticationElement id="link-authentication-element"
        // Prefill the email field like so:
        // options={{defaultValues: {email: 'foo@bar.com'}}}
      // /><PaymentElement />
      <button>Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default CheckoutForm;
```

## Submit the payment to Stripe [Client-side]

Use [stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment) to complete the payment using details from the Payment Element. Provide a [return_url](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/create.md#create_payment_intent-return_url) to this function to indicate where Stripe should redirect the user after they complete the payment. Your user may be first redirected to an intermediate site, like a bank authorization page, before being redirected to the `return_url`. Card payments immediately redirect to the `return_url` when a payment is successful.

#### HTML + JS

```javascript
const form = document.getElementById("payment-form");

form.addEventListener("submit", async (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const { error } = await stripe.confirmPayment({
    //`Elements` instance that was used to create the Payment Element
    elements,
    confirmParams: {
      return_url: "https://example.com/order/123/complete",
    },
  });

  if (error) {
    // This point will only be reached if there is an immediate error when
    // confirming the payment. Show error to your customer (for example, payment
    // details incomplete)
    const messageContainer = document.querySelector("#error-message");
    messageContainer.textContent = error.message;
  } else {
    // Your customer will be redirected to your `return_url`. For some payment
    // methods like iDEAL, your customer will be redirected to an intermediate
    // site first to authorize the payment, then redirected to the `return_url`.
  }
});
```

#### React

To call [stripe.confirmPayment](https://docs.stripe.com/js/payment_intents/confirm_payment) from your payment form component, use the [useStripe](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/stripejs-react.md#usestripe-hook) and [useElements](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/stripejs-react.md#useelements-hook) hooks.

If you prefer traditional class components over hooks, you can instead use an [ElementsConsumer](https://docs.stripe.com/sdks/stripejs-react.md#elements-consumer).

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import {
  useStripe,
  useElements,
  PaymentElement,
} from "@stripe/react-stripe-js";

const CheckoutForm = () => {
  const stripe = useStripe();
  const elements = useElements();

  const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState(null);

  const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    // We don't want to let default form submission happen here,
    // which would refresh the page.
    event.preventDefault();

    if (!stripe || !elements) {
      // Stripe.js hasn't yet loaded.
      // Make sure to disable form submission until Stripe.js has loaded.
      return;
    }
    const { error } = await stripe.confirmPayment({
      //`Elements` instance that was used to create the Payment Element
      elements,
      confirmParams: {
        return_url: "https://example.com/order/123/complete",
      },
    });

    if (error) {
      // This point will only be reached if there is an immediate error when
      // confirming the payment. Show error to your customer (for example, payment
      // details incomplete)
      setErrorMessage(error.message);
    } else {
      // Your customer will be redirected to your `return_url`. For some payment
      // methods like iDEAL, your customer will be redirected to an intermediate
      // site first to authorize the payment, then redirected to the `return_url`.
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <PaymentElement />
      <button disabled={!stripe}>Submit</button>
      {/* Show error message to your customers */}
      {errorMessage && <div>{errorMessage}</div>}
    </form>
  );
};

export default CheckoutForm;
```

Make sure the `return_url` corresponds to a page on your website that provides the status of the payment. When Stripe redirects the customer to the `return_url`, we provide the following URL query parameters:

| Parameter                      | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `payment_intent`               | The unique identifier for the `PaymentIntent`.                                                                                                |
| `payment_intent_client_secret` | The [client secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_intents/object.md#payment_intent_object-client_secret) of the `PaymentIntent` object. |

> If you have tooling that tracks the customer’s browser session, you might need to add the `stripe.com` domain to the referrer exclude list. Redirects cause some tools to create new sessions, which prevents you from tracking the complete session.

Use one of the query parameters to retrieve the PaymentIntent. Inspect the [status of the PaymentIntent](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/paymentintents/lifecycle.md) to decide what to show your customers. You can also append your own query parameters when providing the `return_url`, which persist through the redirect process.

#### HTML + JS

```javascript
// Initialize Stripe.js using your publishable key
const stripe = Stripe("<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>");

// Retrieve the "payment_intent_client_secret" query parameter appended to
// your return_url by Stripe.js
const clientSecret = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get(
  "payment_intent_client_secret",
);

// Retrieve the PaymentIntent
stripe.retrievePaymentIntent(clientSecret).then(({ paymentIntent }) => {
  const message = document.querySelector("#message");

  // Inspect the PaymentIntent `status` to indicate the status of the payment
  // to your customer.
  //
  // Some payment methods will [immediately succeed or fail][0] upon
  // confirmation, while others will first enter a `processing` state.
  //
  // [0]: https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification
  switch (paymentIntent.status) {
    case "succeeded":
      message.innerText = "Success! Payment received.";
      break;

    case "processing":
      message.innerText =
        "Payment processing. We'll update you when payment is received.";
      break;

    case "requires_payment_method":
      message.innerText = "Payment failed. Please try another payment method.";
      // Redirect your user back to your payment page to attempt collecting
      // payment again
      break;

    default:
      message.innerText = "Something went wrong.";
      break;
  }
});
```

#### React

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useStripe } from "@stripe/react-stripe-js";

const PaymentStatus = () => {
  const stripe = useStripe();
  const [message, setMessage] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!stripe) {
      return;
    }

    // Retrieve the "payment_intent_client_secret" query parameter appended to
    // your return_url by Stripe.js
    const clientSecret = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get(
      "payment_intent_client_secret",
    );

    // Retrieve the PaymentIntent
    stripe.retrievePaymentIntent(clientSecret).then(({ paymentIntent }) => {
      // Inspect the PaymentIntent `status` to indicate the status of the payment
      // to your customer.
      //
      // Some payment methods will [immediately succeed or fail][0] upon
      // confirmation, while others will first enter a `processing` state.
      //
      // [0]: https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods#payment-notification
      switch (paymentIntent.status) {
        case "succeeded":
          setMessage("Success! Payment received.");
          break;

        case "processing":
          setMessage(
            "Payment processing. We'll update you when payment is received.",
          );
          break;

        case "requires_payment_method":
          // Redirect your user back to your payment page to attempt collecting
          // payment again
          setMessage("Payment failed. Please try another payment method.");
          break;

        default:
          setMessage("Something went wrong.");
          break;
      }
    });
  }, [stripe]);

  return message;
};

export default PaymentStatus;
```

## Handle refunds and disputes

The refund period for Pay by Bank is up to 730 days (2 years) after the original payment. A refund generally arrives by the next business day but can take up to 7 days to appear as successful. There is no dispute process, customers authenticate with their bank.
