  /**
   * Contracts define a customer's products, pricing, discounts, access duration, and
   * billing configuration. Contracts serve as the central billing agreement for both
   * PLG and Enterprise customers. You can automatically grant customers access to
   * your products and services directly from your product or CRM.
   *
   * ### Use this endpoint to:
   *
   * - PLG onboarding: Automatically provision new self-serve customers with
   *   contracts when they sign up.
   * - Enterprise sales: Push negotiated contracts from Salesforce with custom
   *   pricing and commitments
   * - Promotional pricing: Implement time-limited discounts and free trials through
   *   overrides
   *
   * ### Key components:
   *
   * #### Contract Term and Billing Schedule
   *
   * - Set contract duration using `starting_at` and `ending_before` fields. PLG
   *   contracts typically use perpetual agreements (no end date), while Enterprise
   *   contracts have fixed end dates which can be edited over time in the case of
   *   co-term upsells.
   *
   * #### Rate Card
   *
   * If you are offering usage based pricing, you can set a rate card for the
   * contract to reference through `rate_card_id` or `rate_card_alias`. The rate card
   * is a store of all of your usage based products and their centralized pricing.
   * Any new products or price changes on the rate card can be set to automatically
   * propagate to all associated contracts - this ensures consistent pricing and
   * product launches flow to contracts without manual updates and migrations. The
   * `usage_statement_schedule` determines the cadence on which Metronome will
   * finalize a usage invoice for the customer. This defaults to monthly on the 1st,
   * with options for custom dates, quarterly, or annual cadences. Note: Most usage
   * based billing companies align usage statements to be evaluated aligned to the
   * first of the month. Read more about
   * [Rate Cards](https://docs.metronome.com/pricing-packaging/create-manage-rate-cards/).
   *
   * #### Overrides and discounts
   *
   * Customize pricing on the contract through time-bounded overrides that can target
   * specific products, product families, or complex usage scenarios. Overrides
   * enable two key capabilities:
   *
   * - Discounts: Apply percentage discounts, fixed rate reductions, or
   *   quantity-based pricing tiers
   * - Entitlements: Provide special pricing or access to specific products for
   *   negotiated deals
   *
   * Read more about
   * [Contract Overrides](https://docs.metronome.com/manage-product-access/add-contract-override/).
   *
   * #### Commits and Credits
   *
   * Using commits, configure prepaid or postpaid spending commitments where
   * customers promise to spend a certain amount over the contract period paid in
   * advance or in arrears. Use credits to provide free spending allowances. Under
   * the hood these are the same mechanisms, however, credits are typically offered
   * for free (SLA or promotional) or as a part of an allotment associated with a
   * Subscription.
   *
   * In Metronome, you can set commits and credits to only be applicable for a subset
   * of usage. Use `applicable_product_ids` or `applicable_product_tags` to create
   * product or product-family specific commits or credits, or you can build complex
   * boolean logic specifiers to target usage based on pricing and presentation group
   * values using `override_specifiers`.
   *
   * These objects can also also be configured to have a recurrence schedule to
   * easily model customer packaging which includes recurring monthly or quarterly
   * allotments.
   *
   * Commits support rollover settings (`rollover_fraction`) to transfer unused
   * balances between contract periods, either entirely or as a percentage.
   *
   * Read more about
   * [Credits and Commits](https://docs.metronome.com/pricing-packaging/apply-credits-commits/).
   *
   * #### Subscriptions
   *
   * You can add a fixed recurring charge to a contract, like monthly licenses or
   * seat-based fees, using the subscription charge. Subscription charges are defined
   * on your rate card and you can select which subscription is applicable to add to
   * each contract. When you add a subscription to a contract you need to:
   *
   * - Define whether the subscription is paid for in-advance or in-arrears
   *   (`collection_schedule`)
   * - Define the proration behavior (`proration`)
   * - Specify an initial quantity (`initial_quantity`)
   * - Define which subscription rate on the rate card should be used
   *   (`subscription_rate`)
   *
   * Read more about
   * [Subscriptions](https://docs.metronome.com/manage-product-access/create-subscription/).
   *
   * #### Scheduled Charges
   *
   * Set up one-time, recurring, or entirely custom charges that occur on specific
   * dates, separate from usage-based billing or commitments. These can be used to
   * model non-recurring platform charges or professional services.
   *
   * #### Threshold Billing
   *
   * Metronome allows you to configure automatic billing triggers when customers
   * reach spending thresholds to prevent fraud and manage risk. You can use
   * `spend_threshold_configuration` to trigger an invoice to cover current charges
   * whenever the threshold is reached or you can ensure the customer maintains a
   * minimum prepaid balance using the `prepaid_balance_configuration`.
   *
   * Read more about
   * [Spend Threshold](https://docs.metronome.com/manage-product-access/spend-thresholds/)
   * and
   * [Prepaid Balance Thresholds](https://docs.metronome.com/manage-product-access/prepaid-balance-thresholds/).
   *
   * ### Usage guidelines:
   *
   * - You can always
   *   [Edit Contracts](https://docs.metronome.com/manage-product-access/edit-contract/)
   *   after it has been created, using the `editContract` endpoint. Metronome keeps
   *   track of all edits, both in the audit log and over the `getEditHistory`
   *   endpoint.
   * - Customers in Metronome can have multiple concurrent contracts at one time. Use
   *   `usage_filters` to route the correct usage to each contract.
   *   [Read more about usage filters](https://docs.metronome.com/manage-product-access/provision-customer/#create-a-usage-filter).
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * const contract = await client.v1.contracts.create({
   *   customer_id: '13117714-3f05-48e5-a6e9-a66093f13b4d',
   *   starting_at: '2020-01-01T00:00:00.000Z',
   *   billing_provider_configuration: {
   *     billing_provider: 'stripe',
   *     delivery_method: 'direct_to_billing_provider',

   *   rate_card_id: 'd7abd0cd-4ae9-4db7-8676-e986a4ebd8dc',

   *
   * ### Usage guidelines:

   * customer.
   *
   * #### Impact on commits and credits:
   *
   * When archiving a contract, all associated commits and credits are also archived.
   * For prepaid commits with active segments, Metronome automatically generates
   * expiration ledger entries to close out any remaining balances, ensuring accurate
   * accounting of unused prepaid amounts. These ledger entries will appear in the
   * commit's transaction history with type `PREPAID_COMMIT_EXPIRATION`.
   *

   *
   * Archived contracts remain accessible for historical reporting and audit
   * purposes. They can be retrieved using the `ListContracts` endpoint by setting
   * the `include_archived` parameter to `true` or in the Metronome UI when the "Show

  /**
   * Retrieve the combined current balance across any grouping of credits and commits
   * for a customer in a single API call.
   *
   * - Display real-time available balance to customers in billing dashboards
   * - Build finance dashboards showing credit utilization across customer segments
   * - Validate expected vs. actual balance during billing reconciliation
   *
   * ### Key response fields:
   *
   * - `balance`: The combined net balance available to use at this moment across all
   *   matching commits and credits
   * - `credit_type_id`: The credit type (fiat or custom pricing unit) the balance is
   *   denominated in
   *
   * ### Filtering options:
   *
   * Balance filters allow you to scope the calculation to specific subsets of
   * commits and credits. When using multiple filter objects, they are OR'd together
   * — if a commit or credit matches any filter, it's included in the net balance.
   * Within a single filter object, all specified conditions are AND'd together.
   *
   * - **Balance types**: Include any combination of `PREPAID_COMMIT`,
   *   `POSTPAID_COMMIT`, and `CREDIT` (e.g., `["PREPAID_COMMIT", "CREDIT"]` to
   *   exclude postpaid commits). If not specified, all balance types are included.
   * - **Specific IDs**: Target exact commit or credit IDs for precise balance
   *   queries
   * - **Custom fields**: Filter by custom field key-value pairs; when multiple pairs
   *   are provided, commits must match all of them
   *
   * **Example**: To get the balance of all free-trial credits OR all
   * signup-promotion commits, you'd pass two filter objects — one filtering for
   * CREDIT with custom field campaign: free-trial, and another filtering for
   * PREPAID_COMMIT with custom field campaign: signup-promotion.
   *
   * ### Usage guidelines:
   *
   * - **Balance ledger details**: Use the
   *   [listBalances](https://docs.metronome.com/api-reference/credits-and-commits/list-balances)
   *   endpoint instead to understand detailed ledger drawdowns for each individual
   *   balance
   * - **Draft invoice handling**: Use `invoice_inclusion_mode` to control whether
   *   pending draft invoice deductions are included (`FINALIZED_AND_DRAFT`, the
   *   default) or excluded (`FINALIZED`) from the balance calculation
   * - **Account hierarchies**: When querying a child customer, shared commits from
   *   parent contracts are not included — query the parent customer directly to see
   *   shared commit balances
   * - **Negative balances**: Manual ledger entries can cause negative segment
   *   balances; these are treated as zero when calculating the net balance
   * - **Credit types**: If `credit_type_id` is not specified, the balance defaults
   *   to USD (cents)
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * const response = await client.v1.contracts.getNetBalance({
   *   customer_id: '13117714-3f05-48e5-a6e9-a66093f13b4d',
   *   credit_type_id: '2714e483-4ff1-48e4-9e25-ac732e8f24f2',

   *     {
   *       balance_types: ['CREDIT'],
   *       custom_fields: { campaign: 'free-trial' },
   *     },
   *     {
   *       balance_types: ['PREPAID_COMMIT', 'POSTPAID_COMMIT'],
   *       custom_fields: { campaign: 'signup-promotion' },

   * Retrieve detailed balance for seat-based credits and commits from the contract's
   * subscriptions, broken down by individual seats.
   *
   * ### Use this endpoint to:
   *
   * - Display per-seat balance information in customer dashboards
   * - Filter balance data by subscription or specific seats
   *
   * ### Key response fields:
   *
   * An array of seat balance objects containing:
   *
   * - Seat id
   * - Balance: current total balance across all commits and credits
   *
   * ### Usage guidelines:
   *
   * - Date filtering: use `covering_date` OR `starting_at`/`ending_before` to filter
   *   balance data by time range
   * - Set `include_credits_and_commits=true` for detailed commits and credits
   *   breakdown per seat
   * - Set `include_ledgers=true` for detailed transaction history per commit/credit
   *   per seat
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * const response = await client.v1.contracts.listSeatBalances(
   *   {
   *     contract_id: 'd7abd0cd-4ae9-4db7-8676-e986a4ebd8dc',

  /**
   * If a customer has multiple contracts with overlapping rates, the usage filter

   *
   * As an example, imagine you have a customer associated with two projects. Each

   * group key `project_id` on each contract, and route usage for `project_1` to the
   * first contract and `project_2` to the second contract.
