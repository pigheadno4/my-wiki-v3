# Compare the Payment Element and Card Element

Select the right Element for your payment integration.

> The Card Element is a legacy integration with significantly less functionality than Payment Element. Stripe strongly recommends using the Payment Element to accept payments of all kinds, including card payments.

Previously, each payment method (for example, [cards](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/cards.md) and [iDEAL](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ideal.md)) required integrating a separate Element. Now you can use the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element.md) to accept payments from one or multiple payment methods, including cards and cards alongside other payment methods.

The Payment Element’s integration effort is the same as the Card Element and it supports all the common payment flows. The Payment Element also gives you instant access to additional payment methods, including [Google Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/google-pay.md) and [Apple Pay](https://docs.stripe.com/apple-pay.md). Accepting more [payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/overview.md) can help your business expand its global reach and improve checkout conversion.

Additionally, Stripe continues to develop and improve the Payment Element and its UI based on data from millions of transactions.

If you’re already using the [Card Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/other_element?type=card), migrate to the [Payment Element](https://docs.stripe.com/js/element/payment_element) by following our [migration guide](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-element/migration.md) to ensure you have the most up-to-date Stripe integration.
