# Create a payment link

Create a custom payment page without code.

Use the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create) to create a payment link that you can [share](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/share.md) with your customers. Stripe redirects customers who open this link to a Stripe-hosted payment page.

## Get started

Before you begin, decide what pricing model works best for you:

- **Products or subscriptions**: Best for e-commerce or SaaS where you’re selling products for a fixed price.
- **Customers choose what to pay**: Best for donations, tipping, or pay-what-you-want. This pricing model currently doesn’t support recurring payments or recurring donations. Learn more about the requirements for [accepting tips or donations](https://support.stripe.com/questions/requirements-for-accepting-tips-or-donations).

#### Products or subscriptions

If you want to create product or subscription, create a payment link by completing the following steps:

1. In the Dashboard, open the [Payment Links](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create/standard-pricing) page and click **+New** (or click the plus sign (+) and select **Payment link**).
1. Select an existing product or click **+Add a new product**.
1. If you’re adding a new product, fill out the product details and click **Add product**.
1. Click **Create link**.

#### Customers choose what to pay

To let your customers choose what to pay, create a payment link by completing the following steps:

1. In the Dashboard, open the [Payment Links](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create/customer-chooses-pricing) page and click **New** (or click the plus sign (+) and select **Payment link**).
1. Select **Customers choose what to pay** and add a title, description, and image.
1. (Optional) Set a suggested preset amount.
1. (Optional) Set minimum and maximum payment amounts. By default, the maximum payment amount is 10,000.00 SGD. Contact us using the form at [Stripe support](https://support.stripe.com) to increase this limit.
1. Click **Create link**.

## Get started with the Payment Links API

You can create payment links through the [Payment Links API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_links/payment_links.md). You can use _Products_ (Products represent what your business sells—whether that's a good or a service) and _Prices_ (Prices define how much and how often to charge for products. This includes how much the product costs, what currency to use, and the interval if the price is for subscriptions) to sell products or subscriptions.

#### Products or subscriptions

Payment Links supports the following pricing models:

- Recurring products
  - [Flat rate](https://docs.stripe.com/subscriptions/pricing-models/flat-rate-pricing.md)
  - [Tiered](https://docs.stripe.com/subscriptions/pricing-models/tiered-pricing.md)
- One-off products
  - [Flat rate](https://docs.stripe.com/subscriptions/pricing-models/flat-rate-pricing.md)
  - [Package pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy/pricing-models.md#package-standard-pricing)

First, use a [flat rate](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/pricing-models.md#flat-rate) price to create a product or subscription with a fixed amount.

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const price = await stripe.prices.create({
  currency: "usd",
  unit_amount: 1000,
  product: "{{PRODUCT_ID}}",
});
```

Next, create a payment link by passing in [line_items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_links/payment_links/create.md#create_payment_link-line_items). Each line item contains a [price](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_links/payment_links/create.md#create_payment_link-line_items-price) and [quantity](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_links/payment_links/create.md#create_payment_link-line_items-quantity). You can add up to 20 line items for flat rate prices.

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const paymentLink = await stripe.paymentLinks.create({
  line_items: [
    {
      price: "{{PRICE_ID}}",
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ],
});
```

You can use [price_data](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_links/payment_links/create.md#create_payment_link-line_items-price_data) to create a product and price when you create the payment link.

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_links \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -d "line_items[0][price_data][product_data][name]=T-shirt" \
  -d "line_items[0][price_data][product_data][description]=This is a t-shirt" \
  -d "line_items[0][price_data][currency]=usd" \
  -d "line_items[0][price_data][unit_amount]=1000" \
  -d "line_items[0][quantity]=1"
```

To create a subscription using a payment link, specify a price with [type=recurring](https://docs.stripe.com/api/prices/object.md#price_object-type) for `line_items`. Use [subscription_data](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_links/payment_links/create.md#create_payment_link-subscription_data) to specify the configuration for the subscriptions created from the payment link, including trials:

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const paymentLink = await stripe.paymentLinks.create({
  line_items: [
    {
      price: "{{PRICE_ID}}",
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ],
  subscription_data: {
    trial_period_days: 7,
  },
});
```

#### Customer chooses price

First, set up [variable pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/products-prices/how-products-and-prices-work.md#variable-pricing) to let your customers choose what to pay for tips, donations, or your product or service. Learn more about the requirements for [accepting tips or donations](https://support.stripe.com/questions/requirements-for-accepting-tips-or-donations).

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const price = await stripe.prices.create({
  currency: "usd",
  custom_unit_amount: {
    enabled: true,
  },
  product: "{{PRODUCT_ID}}",
});
```

Next, create a payment link by passing in [line_items](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_links/payment_links/create.md#create_payment_link-line_items). You can include one line item for customer-defined prices.

```curl
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_links \
  -u "<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>:" \
  -d "line_items[0][price_data][product_data][name]=T-shirt" \
  -d "line_items[0][price_data][product_data][description]=This is a t-shirt" \
  -d "line_items[0][price_data][currency]=usd" \
  -d "line_items[0][price_data][unit_amount]=1000" \
  -d "line_items[0][quantity]=1"
```

## Payment Links on mobile

If you’re creating a product or subscription, use the [Stripe Dashboard iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id978516833?pt=91215812&ct=stripe-mobile-app-docs-plinks&mt=8) to create a payment link on your mobile device. In the app, go to **Payments** > **Payment Links** to create a payment link (or click the create icon (+) and select **Payment link**). The iOS app doesn’t currently support creating links where your customers choose how much to pay.

## Configure payment methods

With [Dynamic payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods.md), Stripe displays the most relevant and compatible payment methods to your customers, including Apple Pay and Google Pay. Stripe enables certain payment methods for you by default. We might also enable additional payment methods after notifying you. Use the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) to enable or disable payment methods at any time. Learn more about [supported payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/payment-method-support.md) and [different types of payment methods](https://stripe.com/guides/payment-methods-guide).

You can review what payment methods your customers see in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods/review) by entering a transaction ID or setting an order amount and currency.

To specify a different set of payment methods, set the [payment_method_types](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payment_links/payment_links/create.md#create_payment_link-payment_method_types) parameter when you create the payment link in the API:

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const paymentLink = await stripe.paymentLinks.create({
  line_items: [
    {
      price: "{{PRICE_ID}}",
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ],
  payment_method_types: ["card", "klarna"],
});
```

Some payment methods, such as bank debits or vouchers, might take between 2 and 14 days to confirm the payment. [Set up webhooks](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment.md#create-payment-event-handler) to send you notifications when the payment clears, so you can begin fulfillment.

Your customers will see Apple Pay or Google Pay options if they activated those methods on their device. The payment methods your customers see also depend on the browser they’re using.

#### Item 1

## Let customers pay in their local currency

[Adaptive Pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/currencies/localize-prices/adaptive-pricing.md) lets your customers pay in their local currency in more than 150 countries. With Adaptive Pricing, Stripe uses machine learning to determine the most relevant presentment currency, then automatically calculates the localized price and handles all currency conversion. Adaptive Pricing is always enabled for Payment Links.
