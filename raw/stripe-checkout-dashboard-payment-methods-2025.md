# Migrate payment methods to the Dashboard

Turn on different Checkout payment methods through the Dashboard.

# Hosted page

> This is a Hosted page for when payment-ui is stripe-hosted. View the full page at https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods?payment-ui=stripe-hosted.

By changing your integration to pull your payment method preferences from the Dashboard, Stripe displays all compatible payment methods to your customers when checking out depending on the chosen currency or any payment method restrictions like maximum transaction amounts. Stripe also presents the most relevant payment methods for each customer based on their location and currency used.

The checkout page prioritizes showing payment methods known to increase conversion for your customer’s location while lower priority payment methods are hidden beneath an overflow menu. Your customers see multiple payment methods at checkout that are popular for their location and currency, but they still have the option to choose a different payment method from the overflow menu.

## Update your integration

For existing Stripe Checkout integrations that specify `payment_method_types`, you must remove this parameter to migrate payment methods preferences to the Dashboard. After you remove the parameter from your integration, some payment methods turn on automatically including cards and wallets. The `currency` parameter restricts the payment methods the customer sees in the Checkout Session.

> Upgrading your integration initially turns off any non-default payment methods for your integration, like bank redirects. If you added payment methods to your Checkout integration, you must go to the payment methods settings page in the Dashboard to turn them back on.

#### Node.js

```javascript
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  line_items: [
    {
      price_data: {
        currency: "eur",
        product_data: {
          name: "T-shirt",
        },
        unit_amount: 2000,
      },
      quantity: 1,
    },
  ],
  mode: "payment",
  success_url: "https://example.com/success",
});
```

## View available payment methods in the Dashboard

View your [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) to see the payment methods that you currently accept. This list includes the payment methods turned on by default, like cards. These payment methods cost the same or less than cards and settle immediately.

### Payment methods

By default, Stripe enables cards and other common payment methods. You can turn individual payment methods on or off in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). In Checkout, Stripe evaluates the currency and any restrictions, then dynamically presents the supported payment methods to the customer.

To see how your payment methods appear to customers, enter a transaction ID or set an order amount and currency in the Dashboard.

You can enable Apple Pay and Google Pay in your [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). By default, Apple Pay is enabled and Google Pay is disabled. However, in some cases Stripe filters them out even when they’re enabled. We filter Google Pay if you [enable automatic tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/checkout.md) without collecting a shipping address.

Checkout’s Stripe-hosted pages don’t need integration changes to enable Apple Pay or Google Pay. Stripe handles these payments the same way as other card payments.

## Add or remove payment methods to your integration

On the payment methods settings Dashboard page, you can view the available payment methods and turn on new payment methods for your integration.

You can enable some payment methods just by selecting **Turn on**. However, some payment methods require additional steps to turn them on. For those cases, you’ll see a button that says **Set up** or **Review terms**.

To learn more about which payment methods are right for your business, see our [payment methods guide](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide).

## (Recommended) Handle delayed notification payment methods

Depending on the type of payment method you integrate, there can be a 2-14 day delay in payment confirmation. If you set up _webhooks_ (A webhook is a real-time push notification sent to your application as a JSON payload through HTTPS requests) to [automatically fulfill](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment.md#create-payment-event-handler) orders with your Checkout integration, when you add your first delayed notification payment methods, you might need to update your code.

> This step is only required if you plan to use any of the following payment methods: [Bacs Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/accept-a-payment.md), [Bank transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment.md), [Boleto](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto/accept-a-payment.md), [Canadian pre-authorized debits](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/accept-a-payment.md), [Konbini](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/konbini/accept-a-payment.md), [OXXO](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/oxxo/accept-a-payment.md), [Pay by Bank](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/pay-by-bank/accept-a-payment.md), [SEPA Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment.md), or [ACH Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/accept-a-payment.md).

When receiving payments with a delayed notification payment method, funds aren’t immediately available. It can take multiple days for funds to process so you should delay order _fulfillment_ (Fulfillment is the process of providing the goods or services purchased by a customer, typically after payment is collected) until the funds are available in your account. After the payment succeeds, the underlying _PaymentIntent_ (The Payment Intents API tracks the lifecycle of a customer checkout flow and triggers additional authentication steps when required by regulatory mandates, custom Radar fraud rules, or redirect-based payment methods) status changes from `processing` to `succeeded`.

You’ll need to handle the following Checkout events:

| Event Name                                                                                                                                   | Description                                                                                 | Next steps                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [checkout.session.completed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-checkout.session.completed)                             | The customer has successfully authorized the debit payment by submitting the Checkout form. | Wait for the payment to succeed or fail.                                    |
| [checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded) | The customer’s payment succeeded.                                                           | Fulfill the purchased goods or services.                                    |
| [checkout.session.async_payment_failed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-checkout.session.async_payment_failed)       | The payment was declined, or failed for some other reason.                                  | Contact the customer through email and request that they place a new order. |

These events all include the [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions.md) object.

Update your event handler to fulfill the order:

#### Node.js

```javascript
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

// Find your endpoint's secret in your Dashboard's webhook settings
const endpointSecret = "whsec_...";

// Using Express
const app = require("express")();

// Use body-parser to retrieve the raw body as a buffer
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

const fulfillOrder = (session) => {
  // TODO: fill me in
  console.log("Fulfilling order", session);
};
const createOrder = (session) => {
  // TODO: fill me in
  console.log("Creating order", session);
};

const emailCustomerAboutFailedPayment = (session) => {
  // TODO: fill me in
  console.log("Emailing customer", session);
};

app.post(
  "/webhook",
  bodyParser.raw({ type: "application/json" }),
  (request, response) => {
    const payload = request.body;
    const sig = request.headers["stripe-signature"];

    let event;

    try {
      event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(payload, sig, endpointSecret);
    } catch (err) {
      return response.status(400).send(`Webhook Error: ${err.message}`);
    }
    switch (event.type) {
      case "checkout.session.completed": {
        const session = event.data.object;
        // Save an order in your database, marked as 'awaiting payment'
        createOrder(session);

        // Check if the order is paid (for example, from a card payment)
        //
        // A delayed notification payment will have an `unpaid` status, as
        // you're still waiting for funds to be transferred from the customer's
        // account.
        if (session.payment_status === "paid") {
          fulfillOrder(session);
        }

        break;
      }

      case "checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded": {
        const session = event.data.object;

        // Fulfill the purchase...
        fulfillOrder(session);

        break;
      }

      case "checkout.session.async_payment_failed": {
        const session = event.data.object;

        // Send an email to the customer asking them to retry their order
        emailCustomerAboutFailedPayment(session);

        break;
      }
    }

    response.status(200).end();
  },
);

app.listen(4242, () => console.log("Running on port 4242"));
```

### Testing

Ensure that `stripe listen` is still running. Go through Checkout as a test user, like you did in the prior steps. Your event handler should receive a `checkout.session.completed` event, and you should have successfully handled it.

Now that you’ve completed these steps, you’re ready to go live in production.

# Embedded page

> This is a Embedded page for when payment-ui is embedded-form. View the full page at https://docs.stripe.com/payments/dashboard-payment-methods?payment-ui=embedded-form.

By changing your integration to pull your payment method preferences from the Dashboard, Stripe displays all compatible payment methods to your customers when checking out depending on the chosen currency or any payment method restrictions like maximum transaction amounts. Stripe also presents the most relevant payment methods for each customer based on their location and currency used.

The checkout page prioritizes showing payment methods known to increase conversion for your customer’s location while lower priority payment methods are hidden beneath an overflow menu. Your customers see multiple payment methods at checkout that are popular for their location and currency, but they still have the option to choose a different payment method from the overflow menu.

## Update your integration

For existing Stripe Checkout integrations that specify `payment_method_types`, you must remove this parameter to migrate payment methods preferences to the Dashboard. After you remove the parameter from your integration, some payment methods turn on automatically including cards and wallets. The `currency` parameter restricts the payment methods the customer sees in the Checkout Session.

> Upgrading your integration initially turns off any non-default payment methods for your integration, like bank redirects. If you added payment methods to your Checkout integration, you must go to the payment methods settings page in the Dashboard to turn them back on.

#### Node.js

```javascript
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  line_items: [
    {
      price_data: {
        currency: "eur",
        product_data: {
          name: "T-shirt",
        },
        unit_amount: 2000,

## View available payment methods in the Dashboard

View your [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods) to see the payment methods that you currently accept. This list includes the payment methods turned on by default, like cards. These payment methods cost the same or less than cards and settle immediately.

### Payment methods

By default, Stripe enables cards and other common payment methods. You can turn individual payment methods on or off in the [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). In Checkout, Stripe evaluates the currency and any restrictions, then dynamically presents the supported payment methods to the customer.

To see how your payment methods appear to customers, enter a transaction ID or set an order amount and currency in the Dashboard.

You can enable Apple Pay and Google Pay in your [payment methods settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). By default, Apple Pay is enabled and Google Pay is disabled. However, in some cases Stripe filters them out even when they’re enabled. We filter Google Pay if you [enable automatic tax](https://docs.stripe.com/tax/checkout.md) without collecting a shipping address.

Checkout’s Stripe-hosted pages don’t need integration changes to enable Apple Pay or Google Pay. Stripe handles these payments the same way as other card payments.

## Add or remove payment methods to your integration

On the payment methods settings Dashboard page, you can view the available payment methods and turn on new payment methods for your integration.

You can enable some payment methods just by selecting **Turn on**. However, some payment methods require additional steps to turn them on. For those cases, you’ll see a button that says **Set up** or **Review terms**.

To learn more about which payment methods are right for your business, see our [payment methods guide](https://stripe.com/payments/payment-methods-guide).

## (Recommended) Handle delayed notification payment methods

Depending on the type of payment method you integrate, there can be a 2-14 day delay in payment confirmation. If you set up _webhooks_ (A webhook is a real-time push notification sent to your application as a JSON payload through HTTPS requests) to [automatically fulfill](https://docs.stripe.com/checkout/fulfillment.md#create-payment-event-handler) orders with your Checkout integration, when you add your first delayed notification payment methods, you might need to update your code.

> This step is only required if you plan to use any of the following payment methods: [Bacs Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bacs-debit/accept-a-payment.md), [Bank transfers](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/bank-transfers/accept-a-payment.md), [Boleto](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/boleto/accept-a-payment.md), [Canadian pre-authorized debits](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/acss-debit/accept-a-payment.md), [Konbini](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/konbini/accept-a-payment.md), [OXXO](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/oxxo/accept-a-payment.md), [Pay by Bank](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/pay-by-bank/accept-a-payment.md), [SEPA Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/sepa-debit/accept-a-payment.md), or [ACH Direct Debit](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/ach-direct-debit/accept-a-payment.md).

When receiving payments with a delayed notification payment method, funds aren’t immediately available. It can take multiple days for funds to process so you should delay order _fulfillment_ (Fulfillment is the process of providing the goods or services purchased by a customer, typically after payment is collected) until the funds are available in your account. After the payment succeeds, the underlying _PaymentIntent_ (The Payment Intents API tracks the lifecycle of a customer checkout flow and triggers additional authentication steps when required by regulatory mandates, custom Radar fraud rules, or redirect-based payment methods) status changes from `processing` to `succeeded`.

You’ll need to handle the following Checkout events:

| Event Name                                                                                                                                   | Description                                                                                 | Next steps                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [checkout.session.completed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-checkout.session.completed)                             | The customer has successfully authorized the debit payment by submitting the Checkout form. | Wait for the payment to succeed or fail.                                    |
| [checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded) | The customer’s payment succeeded.                                                           | Fulfill the purchased goods or services.                                    |
| [checkout.session.async_payment_failed](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-checkout.session.async_payment_failed)       | The payment was declined, or failed for some other reason.                                  | Contact the customer through email and request that they place a new order. |

These events all include the [Checkout Session](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions.md) object.

Update your event handler to fulfill the order:

#### Node.js

```javascript
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

// Find your endpoint's secret in your Dashboard's webhook settings
const endpointSecret = "whsec_...";

// Using Express
const app = require("express")();

// Use body-parser to retrieve the raw body as a buffer
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");

const fulfillOrder = (session) => {
  // TODO: fill me in
  console.log("Fulfilling order", session);
};
const createOrder = (session) => {
  // TODO: fill me in
  console.log("Creating order", session);
};

const emailCustomerAboutFailedPayment = (session) => {
  // TODO: fill me in
  console.log("Emailing customer", session);
};

app.post(
  "/webhook",
  bodyParser.raw({ type: "application/json" }),
  (request, response) => {
    const payload = request.body;
    const sig = request.headers["stripe-signature"];

    let event;

    try {
      event = stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(payload, sig, endpointSecret);
    } catch (err) {
      return response.status(400).send(`Webhook Error: ${err.message}`);
    }
    switch (event.type) {
      case "checkout.session.completed": {
        const session = event.data.object;
        // Save an order in your database, marked as 'awaiting payment'
        createOrder(session);

        // Check if the order is paid (for example, from a card payment)
        //
        // A delayed notification payment will have an `unpaid` status, as
        // you're still waiting for funds to be transferred from the customer's
        // account.
        if (session.payment_status === "paid") {
          fulfillOrder(session);
        }

        break;
      }

      case "checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded": {
        const session = event.data.object;

        // Fulfill the purchase...
        fulfillOrder(session);

        break;
      }

      case "checkout.session.async_payment_failed": {
        const session = event.data.object;

        // Send an email to the customer asking them to retry their order
        emailCustomerAboutFailedPayment(session);

        break;
      }
    }

    response.status(200).end();
  },
);

app.listen(4242, () => console.log("Running on port 4242"));
```

### Testing

Ensure that `stripe listen` is still running. Go through Checkout as a test user, like you did in the prior steps. Your event handler should receive a `checkout.session.completed` event, and you should have successfully handled it.

Now that you’ve completed these steps, you’re ready to go live in production.
