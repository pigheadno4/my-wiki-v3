# Payment Element

Embed payment methods directly in your app.

The Payment Element is a customizable drop-in component that [embeds a list of payment methods](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/accept-payment-embedded.md) on any screen in your app. When a customer selects a payment method from the list, a sheet below it collects payment details. You can customize it to match the look and feel of your app. The In-app Payment Element is available in our [iOS](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ios), [Android](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-android), and [React Native](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-react-native) SDKs. See our [accept in-app payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/mobile/accept-payment-embedded.md) guide to get started.

> Android apps in the US that sell digital goods can now process payments in-app using the Payment Element. If you sell digital goods on iOS, see how to implement an app-to-web flow using Stripe Checkout in [Sell in-app digital goods and subscriptions](https://docs.stripe.com/mobile/digital-goods/checkout.md).
