# Instant Payouts for Stripe Dashboard users

Get access to your Stripe balance instantly.

Are you a platform and marketplace interested in offering Instant Payouts to your users? See [Instant Payouts for Connect users](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/instant-payouts.md).

With Instant Payouts, Stripe Dashboard users can access their Stripe balances immediately following a successful charge. You can request an Instant Payout any day or time, including weekends and holidays, and funds typically settle in the associated [payout account](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts.md#manage-payout-methods) within 30 minutes.

## Compare Instant Payouts to standard payouts

Instant Payouts accelerate access to your funds, making them available as soon as funds from a card charge are successfully completed. However, Stripe assesses a fee on each Instant Payout. Any funds not accessed through Instant Payouts continue to be paid out according to your [default payout schedule](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payouts) (standard payouts).

Instant Payouts can’t use [multi-currency settlement](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/multicurrency-settlement.md). For example, an instant payout to a Canadian business must be in CAD.

Funds acquired from card payments are available for Instant Payouts as soon as the charge is complete. ACH or bank debits are only available for Instant Payouts after the payment has settled.

## Request an Instant Payout

You can initiate Instant Payouts either manually through the Stripe Dashboard or programmatically using the Stripe APIs.

#### Dashboard

1. On the [Balances](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview) page, click **Pay out**.
1. If you’re [eligible for Instant Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts.md#eligibility-and-daily-volume-limits) and have a positive balance, select a Standard or Instant payout.
1. If you haven’t added an [eligible Instant Payout method](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts.md#manage-payout-methods), you’re prompted to do so. You only need to add a method once.
1. Enter the amount you want to receive. You can enter up to the maximum amount available, subject to daily volume limits.
1. Select the balance to pay out from and the card to payout to.
1. Click **Review** to review the details.

Funds are paid out immediately and arrive at your payout destination within minutes.

#### API

You can also create an Instant Payout in the API.

1. Call the Balances API to check the `amount` of your `instant_available` balance.

```node
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const balance = await stripe.balance.retrieve();
```

```json
{
  "object": "balance",
  "available": [
    {
      "amount": 10000,
      "currency": "usd",
      "source_types": {
        "card": 10000
      }
    }
  ],
  "instant_available": [
    {
      "amount": 10000,
      "currency": "usd",
      "source_types": {
        "card": 10000
      }
    }
  ],
  "pending": [
    {
      "amount": 0,
      "currency": "usd",
      "source_types": {
        "card": 0
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

If you’re not yet [eligible for Instant Payouts](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts.md#eligibility-and-daily-volume-limits), the `amount` value shows 0.

1. Call the [Payout API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/payouts/create.md) and specify `instant` for the `method` property and enter the debit card or bank account to pay out to as the value of the `destination` property.

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const payout = await stripe.payouts.create({
  amount: 50,
  currency: "usd",
  method: "instant",
  destination: "{{CARD_ID}}",
});
```

## Eligibility and daily volume limits

New Stripe users aren’t immediately eligible for Instant Payouts. Check your eligibility in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview). Eligible users with an available balance see an amount available for Instant Payouts.

You can also use the [Balances API](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_retrieve.md) to see if you have an [instant_available](https://docs.stripe.com/api/balance/balance_object.md#balance_object-instant_available) balance.

An instant payout applies to a daily limit according to the time it’s requested. For example, if you request an instant payout at 23:58 on Tuesday and receive the funds at 00:03 on Wednesday, that payout counts toward Tuesday’s limit. Daily reset times depend on your region:

- US,CA: Midnight US Central Time
- GB: Midnight London Time
- SG: Midnight Singapore Time
- AU: Midnight Sydney Time
- European Union: Midnight Paris Time
- NO: Midnight Oslo Time
- NZ: Midnight Auckland Time
- MY: Midnight Kuala Lumpur Time
- AE: Midnight Dubai Time
- HK: Midnight Hong Kong Time

Instant Payouts observe the following daily limitations:

- You’re limited to a maximum instant payout amount per day. Check your daily volume in the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/balance/overview). You can’t initiate Instant Payouts after you reach your daily limit.
- You’re limited to a maximum of 10 Instant Payouts per day.

## Funds eligibility

The `instant_available` balance reflects only funds eligible for Instant Payouts. The following rules determine what’s included:

- **Payment method:** Card payment funds are available immediately, including pending funds within your payout schedule window. Bank debit funds (ACH, SEPA) are only included after they fully settle, since they can be reversed before that point. Funds from unsupported payment methods are excluded entirely.
- **Currency:** Only currencies Stripe supports for Instant Payouts in your country are included (for example, USD for US accounts).
- **Availability window:** Only funds that become available within roughly 6 business days are included, based on your [payout schedule](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts.md#payout-schedule).
- **Deductions:** Stripe withholds amounts for pending recovery debits and pending [Stripe Capital](https://docs.stripe.com/capital/how-stripe-capital-works.md) loan repayments to prevent negative balances.
- **Fees:** The Instant Payout fee is pre-deducted so the balance shown reflects what you’d actually receive. See [Pricing](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts.md#pricing) for rates.
- **Daily limit:** The balance is capped at your remaining daily instant payout allowance. See [Eligibility and daily volume limits](https://docs.stripe.com/payouts/instant-payouts.md#eligibility-and-daily-volume-limits) for details.

## Pricing

Stripe charges Dashboard users a 1% fee for all Instant Payouts for CA, EU, UK, SG, NO, HK and MY, and a 1.5% fee for US, AU, NZ, and AE. Each Instant Payout transaction has a minimum and maximum amount dependent on the currency.
