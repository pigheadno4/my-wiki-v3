# Dispute reason code categories

Learn about reason code categories and evidence guidelines.

Each payment method (such as a card, digital wallet, Buy now, Pay Later), defines hundreds of codes that represent specific reasons for dispute claims. These reasons often overlap across all of the different payment networks, thus Stripe organizes each payment method’s codes into one of eight categories. Each category is based on the general type of claim and the evidence required to effectively challenge it. You can manage disputes using the [Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding.md) or the [API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api.md).

## Reason code categories

The following tables show the Stripe categories for each payment method’s dispute reason codes. The reason code is available on the [dispute object](https://docs.stripe.com/api/disputes/object.md#dispute_object-payment_method_details-card-network_reason_code). For more information about Visa, Mastercard, and Amex, see [Dispute reason codes](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/reason-codes-defense-requirements.md).

## Category defense guidelines

Use the selector to choose the category that matches the reason given for your dispute to see guidelines for responding.

#### Credit not processed

The customer claims they’re entitled to a full or partial refund because they returned the purchased product or didn’t fully use it, or the transaction was otherwise canceled or not fully fulfilled, but you haven’t yet provided a refund or credit.

### How to prevent it

- Have a clear return or cancellation policy that’s easy to find or explicitly disclosed to the customer prior to purchase.
- Honor your written policies promptly when a customer requests and is entitled to a full or partial refund.

### How to overturn it

Explain and demonstrate one or more of the following:

- You already issued the refund your customer is entitled to
- The customer isn’t entitled to a refund
- The customer [withdrew the dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/withdrawing.md)

Choose the product type of the disputed transaction to see relevant evidence suggestions.

- **Physical products** are tangible goods that were either purchased in a store or shipped to the recipient, so evidence often proves the customer is in possession of the item.
- **Digital products or services** are often virtual in nature and don’t have trackable shipping data, so focus on evidence of usage, login, or download.
- **Offline services** include purchases that are made in advance, such as event tickets and reservations, where evidence of a cancellation policy can be material.

#### evidence you can submit for - Physical product

| For this type of recommended evidence | Designate this Dashboard label or API parameter |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |

| The language of your refund policy, as provided to the customer. This might be:

- The text copied from your policy page

- A PDF of the applicable part of your business’s terms and conditions | `refund_policy` |
  | An explanation of how and where the applicable policy was provided to your customer prior to purchase. | `refund_policy_disclosure` |
  | Your explanation for why the customer isn’t entitled to a refund, or no further refund, if you already issued a partial refund. | `refund_refusal_explanation` |
  | Whether or not the customer attempted to resolve the issue with you prior to filing a dispute. If they didn’t reach out to you before the dispute, state that clearly.

If you did communicate with them prior to the dispute, or if later conversations shed light on the facts of the case, submit this with your evidence. This could look like:

- A screenshot of a text conversation
- A PDF of an email exchange
- A PDF of your written account of a phone conversation, including dates of contact | `customer_communication` |
  | Any argument invalidating the dispute reason, such as a PDF or screenshot showing:

- Whether you already issued the refund the cardholder is entitled to
- Whether or not the customer returned the merchandise in whole or in part. If they partially used the merchandise or returned it, or whether the dispute amount exceeds the value of the unused portion

#### Duplicate

The customer claims they were charged multiple times for the same product or service.

### How to prevent it

- If a customer’s card is accidentally charged more than once for a single payment, correct the duplicates immediately and get in touch with the customer to let them know you’ve handled the issue.
- Send detailed receipts that explain every payment and make it easy to distinguish the unique reason for each.
- If you built your own Stripe integration, ensure it can [handle errors](https://docs.stripe.com/api/errors/handling.md) without double-charging.
- Honor your written policies promptly when a customer requests and is entitled to a refund for a duplicate payment.

### How to overturn it

Explain and demonstrate one or more of the following:

- Each payment was for a separate product or service
- You already issued a refund to your customer
- The customer [withdrew the dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/withdrawing.md)

Choose the product type of the disputed transaction to see relevant evidence suggestions.

- **Physical products** are tangible goods that were either purchased in a store or shipped to the recipient, so evidence often proves the customer is in possession of the item.
- **Digital products or services** are often virtual in nature and don’t have trackable shipping data, so focus on evidence of usage, login, or download.

#### Fraudulent

This is the most common reason for a dispute and happens when a cardholder claims that they didn’t authorize the payment. The cardholder might have made an error and failed to recognize a legitimate charge on their credit card statement, or they might have genuinely been a victim of someone using their card fraudulently. This is a difficult dispute type to win because in many cases the reason for the dispute is correct. If you believe the payment was indeed fraud, the appropriate action is to either [accept the dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/responding.md) or decline to challenge it.

### How to prevent it

Because fraud disputes are so difficult to win, prevention is key. Good strategies include:

- Make sure your [statement descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors.md) is easily recognizable to your customers and reflects the URL or business name they would associate with their purchase
- Send [receipts](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts.md) upon payment so your customers can remember what they paid for
- Familiarize yourself with the [best practices for preventing fraud](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/prevention/best-practices.md)

### How to overturn it

Explain and demonstrate one or more of the following:

- That the legitimate cardholder—or an authorized representative (such as an employee or family member)—did in fact make the payment
- That the payment was successfully authenticated with _3D Secure_ (3D Secure (3DS) provides an additional layer of authentication for credit card transactions that protects businesses from liability for fraudulent card payments) and should therefore fall under liability shift (Stripe provides the _Electronic Commerce Indicator (ECI)_ (An Electronic Commerce Indicator (ECI) is a code returned alongside a 3D Secure authentication result. It indicates the authentication method and result and may be used subsequently to, for example, determine eligibility for liability shift) automatically for you)
- You already issued a refund to the cardholder
- The customer [withdrew the dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/withdrawing.md) or otherwise acknowledged they recognize the charge and filed the fraud dispute in error
- For Visa specifically, provide [Compelling Evidence](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/categories.md#visa)

> Visa disputes with reason code 10.5 are extremely rare and have no recourse to remedy the dispute. Visa considers these types of transactions fraudulent by Visa and doesn’t accept evidence for these disputes.

Choose the product type of the disputed transaction to see relevant evidence suggestions.

- **Physical products** are tangible goods that were either purchased in a store or shipped to the recipient, so evidence often proves the customer is in possession of the item.
- **Digital products or services** are often virtual in nature and don’t have trackable shipping data, so focus on evidence of usage, login, or download.
- **Offline services** include purchases that are made in advance, such as event tickets and reservations, where evidence of a cancellation policy can be material.

#### General

This is an uncategorized dispute, so contact the customer for additional details to find out why they disputed the payment. This should be fairly rare for cards disputes.

#### Product not received

The customer claims they did not receive the products or services purchased.

### How to prevent it

- For physical products, promptly ship them after payment is made
- Estimate shipping and delivery dates as accurately as you can, and communicate clearly with your customer. If shipping delays arise unexpectedly, keep your customer informed.
- Save shipping labels, and for high-value products consider requiring a signature upon receipt.
- Make it easy for your customers to reach out when they have issues receiving their products (for example: send [receipts](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts.md) upon payment so your customers can easily reply to get in touch).
- For digital goods or services, maintain access logs or documentation that tie usage back to the customer.
- Honor your written policies promptly when a customer requests a full or partial refund they’re entitled to for products or services they didn’t receive.

### How to overturn it

Explain and demonstrate one or more of the following:

- The product was in fact delivered or isn’t expected to have been delivered yet (for example, the agreed-upon delivery date is still in the future)
- You already issued a refund to the cardholder
- The customer [withdrew the dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/withdrawing.md)

Choose the product type of the disputed transaction to see relevant evidence suggestions.

- **Physical products** are tangible goods that were either purchased in a store or shipped to the recipient, so evidence often proves the customer is in possession of the item.
- **Digital products or services** are often virtual in nature and don’t have trackable shipping data, so focus on evidence of usage, login, or download.

#### Product unacceptable

The customer received the product but claims it was defective or damaged in some way, or was not described or represented in an accurate manner prior to purchase.

### How to prevent it

- Ensure that the description of products or services shown in advertisements, online, and transaction receipts, or used in telephone order-taking scripts are accurate, complete, and not misleading.
- Never refer cardholders to the manufacturer in lieu of attempting to resolve the issue directly—the business selling the product or service is liable and must be the point of contact for resolution.

### How to overturn it

Explain and demonstrate one or more of the following:

- That the product or service was accurately represented prior to purchase
- That the product wasn’t damaged or defective
- You already issued a refund to your customer
- The customer [withdrew the dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/withdrawing.md)

Choose the product type of the disputed transaction to see relevant evidence suggestions.

- **Physical products** are tangible goods that were either purchased in a store or shipped to the recipient, so evidence often proves the customer is in possession of the item.
- **Digital products or services** are often virtual in nature and don’t have trackable shipping data, so focus on evidence of usage, login, or download.
- **Offline services** include purchases that are made in advance, such as event tickets and reservations, where evidence of a cancellation policy can be material.

#### Subscription canceled

The customer claims that you continued to charge them after a subscription was canceled.

### How to prevent it

- Promptly cancel subscriptions upon request, making sure to pass the cancellation along to Stripe if you use our [subscription](https://docs.stripe.com/billing.md) functionality and provide your customer with a confirmation of the cancellation.
- Make it clear on your signup page that your customers are agreeing to a recurring payment and include information about whether or not you plan to notify the customer before each payment.
- Make sure cancellation procedures and policies are clearly communicated to your customers.

### How to overturn it

Explain and demonstrate one or more of the following:

- The subscription was still active and that the customer was aware of, and did not follow, your cancellation procedure.
- You already issued a refund to your customer
- The customer [withdrew the dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/withdrawing.md)

#### Unrecognized

The customer doesn’t recognize the payment appearing on their card statement. This is effectively indistinguishable from the Fraudulent reason.

### How to prevent it

- Make sure your [statement descriptor](https://docs.stripe.com/get-started/account/statement-descriptors.md) is easily recognizable to your customers and reflects the URL or business name they would associate with their purchase
- Send [receipts](https://docs.stripe.com/receipts.md) upon payment so your customers can recall what they paid for

### How to overturn it

Explain and demonstrate one or more of the following:

- That the legitimate cardholder—or an authorized representative (such as an employee or family member)—did in fact make the payment
- You already issued a refund to the cardholder
- The customer [withdrew the dispute](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/withdrawing.md) or otherwise acknowledged they recognize the charge and filed the fraud dispute in error

#### Noncompliant

Businesses receive Visa compliance disputes in certain cases when the card issuer believes the disputed transaction doesn’t conform to Visa’s network rules. If Visa compliance disputes can’t be resolved between the parties, the dispute is resolved by the network in exchange for a fee.

If you contest a Visa compliance dispute, in addition to the applicable Stripe dispute fees, Stripe collects a 500 USD (or local equivalent) amount to cover the network costs associated with resolving Visa compliance disputes. Stripe refunds the 500 USD network fee if you win the dispute. Learn how to [respond to Visa compliance disputes using the API](https://docs.stripe.com/disputes/api/visa-compliance.md).

> Compliance cases filed by issuers are referred to as pre-compliance disputes by Visa. Learn more about [Visa rules](https://usa.visa.com/content/dam/VCOM/download/about-visa/visa-rules-public.pdf).
