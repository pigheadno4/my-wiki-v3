# Create an embeddable buy button

Use Payment Links to create an embeddable buy button for your website.

Create an embeddable buy button to sell a product, subscription, or accept a payment on your website. Start by selecting an existing link from the [Payment Links list view](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links) or by [creating a new link](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payment-links/create) where you can decide which products to sell and customize the checkout UI. After you create your link, click **Buy button** to configure the buy button design and generate the code that you can copy and paste into your website.

## Customize the button

By default, your buy button uses the same branding and call to action configured for your payment link. You can:

- Choose between a simple button and a card widget.
- Set brand colors, shapes, and fonts to match your website.
- Set the language of the button and payment page to match your website’s language.
- Customize your button’s call to action.

Customize the buy button

## Embed the button

Stripe provides an embed code composed of a `<script>` tag and a `<stripe-buy-button>` web component. Click **Copy code** to copy the code and paste it into your website.

If you’re using HTML, paste the embed code into the HTML. If you’re using React, include the `script` tag in your `index.html` page to mount the `<stripe-buy-button>` component.

> The buy button uses your account’s [publishable API key](https://docs.stripe.com/keys.md#obtain-api-keys). If you revoke the API key, you need to update the embed code with your new publishable API key.

#### React

```html
<head>
  <!-- Paste the script snippet in the head of your app's index.html -->
  <script async src="https://js.stripe.com/v3/buy-button.js"></script>
</head>
```

```jsx
import * as React from "react";

function BuyButtonComponent() {
  // Paste the stripe-buy-button snippet in your React component
  return (
    <stripe-buy-button
      buy-button-id="{{BUY_BUTTON_ID}}"
      publishable-key="<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>"
    ></stripe-buy-button>
  );
}

export default BuyButtonComponent;
```

| `client-reference-id`            | Use `client-reference-id` to attach a unique string of your choice to the `CheckoutSession`. The string can be a customer ID, a cart ID, or something similar that you use to reconcile the `CheckoutSession` with your internal systems. If you pass this parameter to your `<stripe-buy-button>`, it’s sent in the [checkout.session.completed webhook](https://docs.stripe.com/api/events/types.md#event_types-checkout.session.completed) upon payment completion. | The `client-reference-id` can contain alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores, and be any value up to 200 characters. Invalid values are silently dropped, but your payment page continues to work as expected. |
| `customer-email`                 | Use `customer-email` to prefill the email address on the payment page. When the property is set, the buy button passes it to the `CheckoutSession`’s `customer_email` attribute. The customer can’t edit the email address on the payment page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | The `customer-email` must be a valid email. Invalid values are silently dropped, but your payment pages continues to work as expected.                                                                                  |
| `customer-session-client-secret` | Use `customer-session-client-secret` to [pass an existing customer](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/buy-button.md#pass-an-existing-customer).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | The `customer-session-client-secret` value must be generated from the [client_secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_sessions/object.md#customer_session_object-client_secret).                                   |

## Pass an existing customer

> #### Use the Accounts v2 API to represent customers
>
> The Accounts v2 API is generally available for Connect users, and in public preview for other Stripe users. If you’re part of the Accounts v2 preview, you need to specify a [specify a preview version](https://docs.stripe.com/api-v2-overview.md#sdk-and-api-versioning) in your code.
>
> To request access to the Accounts v2 preview,
>
> For most use cases, we recommend [modeling your customers as customer-configured Account objects](https://docs.stripe.com/connect/use-accounts-as-customers.md) instead of using [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers.md) objects.

#### Accounts v2

You can provide an existing [customer-configured Account](https://docs.stripe.com/api/v2/core/accounts/object.md#v2_account_object-configuration-customer) object to `CheckoutSessions` created from the buy button. Authenticate the customer on the server, then create a `CustomerSession` for them and return the [client_secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_sessions/object.md#customer_session_object-client_secret) to the client.

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const customerSession = await stripe.customerSessions.create({
  customer_account: "{{CUSTOMERACCOUNT_ID}}",
  components: {
    buy_button: {
      enabled: true,
    },
  },
});
```

#### Customer v1

You can provide an existing [Customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customers.md) object to `CheckoutSessions` created from the buy button. Authenticate the customer on the server, then create a `CustomerSession` for them and return the [client_secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_sessions/object.md#customer_session_object-client_secret) to the client.

```node
// Don't put any keys in code. See https://docs.stripe.com/keys-best-practices.
// Find your keys at https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys.
const stripe = require("stripe")("<<YOUR_SECRET_KEY>>");

const customerSession = await stripe.customerSessions.create({
  customer: "{{CUSTOMER_ID}}",
  components: {
    buy_button: {
      enabled: true,
    },
  },
});
```

Set the `customer-session-client-secret` attribute on the `<stripe-buy-button>` web component to the [client_secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_sessions/object.md#customer_session_object-client_secret) from the CustomerSession.

You must provide the [client_secret](https://docs.stripe.com/api/customer_sessions/object.md#customer_session_object-client_secret) within 30 minutes. After providing the client secret, you have an additional 30 minutes until the `CustomerSession` expires. After it expires, the buy button can’t create any `CheckoutSessions`.

Don’t cache the client secret. Instead, generate a new one every time you render a buy button.

#### React

```jsx
import * as React from "react";

function BuyButtonComponent() {
  return (
    <stripe-buy-button
      buy-button-id="{{BUY_BUTTON_ID}}"
      publishable-key="<<YOUR_PUBLISHABLE_KEY>>"
      customer-session-client-secret="{{CLIENT_SECRET}}"
    ></stripe-buy-button>
  );
}

export default BuyButtonComponent;
```

## Content Security Policy

If you’ve deployed a [Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), the policy directives that the buy button requires are:

- frame-src, https://js.stripe.com
- script-src, https://js.stripe.com

## Limitations

Rendering the buy button requires a website domain. To test the buy button locally, run a local HTTP server to host your website’s `index.html` file over the localhost domain. To run a local HTTP server, use Python’s [SimpleHTTPServer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server#running_a_simple_local_http_server) or the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) npm module.

## Track payments

After your customer makes a payment using a payment link, you can see it in the [payments overview](https://dashboard.stripe.com/payments) in the Dashboard.

If you’re new to Stripe, you receive an email after your first payment. To receive emails for all successful payments, update your notification preferences in your [Personal details](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/user) settings.

If you’re selling a subscription or [saving a payment method for future use](https://docs.stripe.com/payment-links/customize.md#save-payment-details-for-future-use) and don’t specify an existing customer, the Checkout Session creates a new [customer](https://docs.stripe.com/api/checkout/sessions/create.md#create_checkout_session-customer_creation). For one-time payments, the Checkout Session uses a [guest customer](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/guest-customers.md) instead.
